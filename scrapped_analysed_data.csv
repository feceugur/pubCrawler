Teleferic,"my first day in barcelona was made unforgettable by teleferic landing in barcelona, with its streets echoing tales of old and new, i was a solo traveler with a heart full of wanderlust and an empty stomach. on my very first evening, i stumbled upon teleferic, and let me tell you, it felt like striking culinary gold. walking in, the vibe of the place wrapped around me like a warm hug. there s something about the ambiance that s just so inviting, making a solo diner like me feel right at home. it was bustling yet comfortable, lively yet intimate a perfect blend of everything i didnt know i needed. enter gemma, the star of the evening (apart from the food, of course). fluent in english and with a kindness thats rare, she navigated me through the menu with the ease of a friend suggesting their favorites. each dish she recommended was like a piece of barcelona on a plate, and for a moment, i felt less like a tourist and more like a local. the tapas oh, the tapas! every bite of the crispy tuna tartare tacos and pork ribs was a revelation, a blend of flavors so divine, i couldn t help but savor each bite as if it were my last. and just when i thought it couldn t get any better, the dessert arrived, sweeping me off my feet all over again. dining alone in a new city can be daunting, but teleferic turned it into an adventure. my first day in barcelona ended with a belly full of amazing food and a heart full of gratitude. if you ever find yourself wandering the streets of this enchanting city, make your way to teleferic. it s not just a meal; it s an experience a deliciously unforgettable one at that.","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.92972153}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.06685929}, {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0034191536}]","['celona', 'crispy tuna tartare tacos', 'pork ribs', 'gemma', 'teleferic', 'dessert']"

Vinitus,"one-line review: this guy s honey cod, honey cod, really~ in conclusion, the honey cod was delicious. ever since i said i was going to barcelona from korea, ive heard so much about how delicious the honey cod is. just hearing the sound of that damn honey cod made me irritated, but it was delicious. the combination of sweet and salty with the sourness of tomatoes, the chewiness of slightly dried cod, and the umami of garlic made it quite perfect (the exact name is cod with honey aioli sauce). this seems to be the first store, but unlike the second store, if you type the name in korean, it doesnt come out, so it seems like its hard to see korean people. i ordered a variety of other dishes as well. 1. grilled mat clams: it was about 11 euros, but i was disappointed that it was a bit bland and lacked searing. the clams themselves are very delicious, but if you want to eat a decent one, you have to pay at least 20 euros for a bowl, or you can only eat 3 or 4 pieces. 2. fried red pepper: a non-spicy vegetable that s good to eat as a side. 3. grilled beef and foie gras: the beef was quite delicious and went well with the bread, but the foie gras was a bit fishy. it would have been much better if it had just beef or peppers. 4. grilled shrimp and squid skewers: this was quite good value for money. if i hadnt decided not to order it again after eating it once, i would have eaten it again. 5. pan conto mate: i ordered it because it was so basic, but it was tasteless and not very sincere. 6. calamari: this one was also very delicious. squid with thin breadcrumbs and exquisite liver. it was very delicious 7. shrimp squid croquette: i ordered it because it was todays menu and it was quite delicious. it was quite filling as there were pieces of seafood inside. 8. grilled kalsot: a dish that looks like korean green onions and is made by roasting them in the oven. although it had sweet vegetable juice, it had a very soft texture. however, it is a bit difficult to eat alone and it takes a while to come out compared to other dishes, so you will need to allocate your time well. it was about 75 euros for eating like this and 3 drinks, so it wasnt bad.","[{'label': 'Error', 'score': 0.0}]","['o mate', 'korean green onions', 'grilled mat clams', 'aioli sauce', 'honey cod', 'foie gras', 'shrimp squid croquette', 'grilled', 'alsot', 'fried red pepper']"

Vegan Junk Food Bar,"its a restaurant im going to for the third time, but this last time, unfortunately, it left a lot to be desired... first of all, the cook had to leave the kitchen to act as a waiter... since when does a boss allow that? due to hygiene and the chefs rights, it should not... furthermore, neither the cook nor the waitress (the only employees) knew either spanish or catalan, and for my part there is no problem because we know english, but you have to empathize with all the customers and im sure they will. not only tourists access the premises, and we are in barcelona then the manager arrived, and since the starter had arrived a while ago but not the drinks, we asked about them. it turns out that he had just arrived and answered in an unpleasant and cocky way, so by not waiting for the answer we began to feel uncomfortable. when the drink arrived, the man continued to treat us rudely, until i decided to ask for the complaint form and he gave us trouble by leaving us a pen. in the end i got it and unfortunately the sheet goes to consumer offices... its a shame, but if they had known how to stop at the time and apologize this would not have gone to the end.","[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7261146}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.2606377}, {'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.01324772}]",[]

(the dishes in the photo, plus two bottles that are filled from the tap  66.80) no one asked us how we were, no one offered help, no one had any kind of consideration in explaining what was happening, and i saw the waitress explain to 2 other people in the restaurant what had happened. finally he was quite scared because we went to the nearest pharmacy to buy ventolin. ive been 3 times, but it will be the last. update 2/12/24 they contacted me by phone, which i couldnt answer, to ask my partner to come. they sent me an email to contact me and inform me that they updated the menu with ingredients that were not detailed and they had the gesture of offering us a gift voucher with the amount of the dinner. with this gesture (and not only for the invitation, but for what was described above) i have added stars for customer service.","[{'label': 'Error', 'score': 0.0}]","['coconut butter', 'cheesecake', 'reserved table', 'wedding celebration', 'fabric hearts', 'dessert']"

Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"after having traveled all over spain for the past two weeks and being ,quite frankly, tired of spanish cuisine, this really hit the spot. as a singaporean who now lives in the states, the food here was able to transport me back and fill me with a sense of nostalgia. my wife and i ate here for 3 days in a row due to how amazing the food was. auntie agnes and her staff were able to recommend and create a variety of mouth watering dishes. as you can see in the pictures, we ordered a plethora of dishes and covered a lot of the menu. the staff was world class and the service was impeccable. the dishes were authentic and the char kway teow and mee goreng even had  wok hei , something that s elusive in asian restaurants in the western part of the world. the chilis- sambal, chili padi, and chicken rice chili were exceptional as well- every south east asian knows that it s as important as the meal itself. the little details such as achar(pickled vegetables) with the nasi lemak was an authentic touch i ve not seen outside of the  the motherland . while i may be biased, the labor intensive dishes such as nyonya kuehs-which are easy to overlook- are truly a work of culinary art. overall gem of a restaurant. 20/10. one of the few reasons i would return to barcelona. thank you very much auntie agnes and the rest of the staff for the wonderful experience!","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.91570675}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.06344143}, {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.020851864}]","['culinary art', 'asian restaurants', 'chicken rice chili']"

(it was delicious!) we ordered a lot of food, and every single dish was amazing and hit the spot. i did miss the tiny anchovies for the nasi lemak, but sometimes, other parts of the experience make up for a tiny lack of something i expected. in this case, the servers kindness made it exceptional. the satays were tasty and moist, although they were rather large chunks of meat. the singapore noodles were exactly what i wanted and a good blend of savoury elements. nothing was too oily, and they are not afraid of the spice here if you let them know. the char kway teow was exceptional. i dont even like prawns and the flavours were wonderful. the wok hei came through so well. i cannot express how much i loved the yam cake. i have been missing it so much and finally a place that does it expertly. it is quite a large restaurant with a big, colourful dining room, and a more intimate eating area in the front for people who just want to eat with a book, or similar, in a quieter section. as a little bonus, my partner is cantonese, and the boss lady spoke cantonese with her, which was such a delight as she rarely gets to so in europe, and they have the same name! :) malaysian food used to be one of my least favourite asian cuisines, but because of restaurants like this is it up near the top now.  i cant wait to come back next time!","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.97539854}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.020010022}, {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.0045914175}]","['singapore noodles', 'yam cake', 'barley juice', 'authentic malay restaurant', 'wok hei', 'asian cuisines', 'char kway teow']"

The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"its really delicious   i ordered it by glovo after making two attempts at other restaurants and i kept getting an error. i didnt try it. i did a google search and it seems like it was something about the connection, although later it occurred to me that maybe the other restaurants werent operating, or the address didnt cover my area. although its strange because one of them has already brought me home to my ksa, but i ordered it by deliveroo... it may be that they have different restaurants... well the case, as well as who doesnt want the thing i said: lets see if in another restaurant works, because i really wanted to eat something delicious and healthy and i also received an email from glovo giving me a  5 bonus     and i wanted to take advantage of it! once it happened to me with deliveroo, but i had to place a minimum order of  30     and no that made me very angry   what a discount that is  they force you to spend  30 to give you a mini discount! no! i refused, it was beyond what for me is a discount     i loved glovo because the minimum order was  10 and that was within my mental and monetary possibilities    the first one i saw was the fresh poke and yay, a bowl with salmon,    mango and   made my eyes go crazy, its called philsalmon poke, small size,  9.90  i added two chocolate mochis for  2 in total, applying the discount, it came out to  11.49     one excellent investment in me     today i wanted salmon, although i almost never eat meat or animals anymore, i like to say that i am flexiterana! most of the time i eat more vegetarian or vegan style   but i leave some space    for those whims that sometimes my body or my head asks of me and the truth is that it makes me very happy   that flexibility       the flavors of my poke ugh, i loved them, the only thing i thought was that the little one was very small but like when i ordered it, there wasnt any photo to give me an idea of the size because i couldnt assess it... although at least it looks good. i loved the mochos, especially the flavor of the filling, super creamy, with that hint of chocolate on top  they brought my order quickly! luis, a kinder and funnier man, i felt like giving him a hug   although i didnt, this covid-19 thing has us crossed arms. i dont know if ill see it again but it left a nice memory in my heart! glovo a round of applause   for that glover number 10   well i think thats all for today! if you ask, tell me what you think, you can find me on networks like khassilda, where i share the most is twitter and tik tok, youtube, but im also on instagram or facebook and lbry! better said, im in a thousand places hahaha i lose my temper sometimes        but i have fun, which is whats important! well, its a pleasure to have shared this little time together     i hope we meet again somewhere in the world   or cyber    space! mu@k remu@k with love   khassilda oh my name is angela maria escobar vela","[{'label': 'Error', 'score': 0.0}]","['glovo', 'chocolate mochis', 'salmon', 'philsalmon poke', 'deliveroo']"

Enoteca Paco Perez,"it is my second time at the enoteca. the first one with the full tasting menu, this time the weekend rice menu. the dining room is welcoming, very well designed. maybe the music was too loud (likely more and american style restaurant, in the traditional  spanish restaurants we have less or no background music, it is a cultural thing). the personnel was welcoming and very polite. the lead waitress was very talented, knowledgeable and pleasant. the secondary waiters did a good job as well. the sommelier gave us a great recommendation regarding a chardonnay  from the penedes and a tokaji after lunch. he gave us the right explanations but he did not overextend them, which felt perfect. the menu itself was 4 starters with small bites centered on sea products (cod, melva-anchovies, exquisite small smoked peas...). there is a bread tasting which was ok, but the starters and the rice were really the main characters. the rice was paella style for the non-spanish readers. rice with sea urchin, mushrooms. most of the dishes had some black truffle. i am not a fan of truffle, but on this occasion i have to admit that it was fresh, it did not hide the other flavors and it was used wisely by the chef, great! products were local and really fresh. the rice was wonderful with the soft sea urchin touch. the first desert was a brie cheese pastry and the second a sweet complex composition winter-themed, difficult to describe, but with an excellent and refreshing taste. petit fours were offered with coffee. my only complaint is that the coffee was clearly a capsule-coffee, the taste was clear and i was able to see the machine later. i think it was the only detail that did not match with this extraordinary restaurant. we had a great time, 200 euros per person all included, which might seem expensive but i think it is up to the level of the restaurant and according to other first tier restaurants in barcelona. we will certainly return for a special occasion.","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9677554}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.028497215}, {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.003747372}]","['enoteca', 'background music', 'petit fours', 'bread tasting', 'coffee', 'paella style', 'first tier restaurants', 'brie cheese pastry', 'weekend rice menu', 'desert']"

Enoteca Paco Perez,"overrated restaurant. this was my 15th michelin restaurant visit and for the first time i am very disappointed. the service is flawless but the food and plating is not michelin 2 star quality. it feels like a tourist trap for rich clueless people that think a 700 euro dinner is amazing because of the price tag and service and not because of the quality of the food. the tasting menue should first of all be renamed  16 spoons or 16 bites  or something because the majority of the dishes are so tiny i would not call them a dish. it is like it was plated for dolls in a doll house. for the first dish i am served chicken broth although we been promised a pescatarian menu and no bird / no meat. the best tasting dish the red mullet is so small it is not even a mouthful. we got 2 cm of fish. just ridiculous and cheap. the shrimps lack seasoning and freshness of some acidic element. the shrimp is served with the black  shitstrings  intestines not removed. on a two star restaurant come on!!! the rest of the menue is one dimensional cooking. often under seasoned and bland. frankly the majority of the dishes don t taste much. all desserts are boring and lacks freshness. it feels like the  chefs fokused all on umami but forgot the other key elements to a great desserts. it is no fireworks, no explosions of tastes in our mouths. one at the table who is allergic to nuts get the food and desserts with no decorations at all and no crunch or structure. despite the restaurant being informed about this when the booking was done. the autumn is the only dessert with nice decorations. it taste ok. nothing special. the best dessert is the petit fours. it is 4 cute small cookies only millimeters in size and you feel like a giant eating them. overall a very disappointed experience. expect around 350 euro a minimum per person for a dinner here. value for money? not at all. the first time i rather felt robbed after leaving a restaurant and i eat on fine dining restaurants on a regular basis and gladly pay for a great food experience. we shared the  restaurant with only 6 other guests on three tables. the rest of the tables were unbooked. i understand why. barcelona is one of my favorite cities in europe with lots of great restaurants so choose wisely and avoid this one. i can t understand this gets 5/5 from other reviewers. this was far from that. i give this restaurant 2/5 because of the service and staff. they did a great job. but the food should be the hero and it is not.","[{'label': 'Error', 'score': 0.0}]","['chicken broth', 'petit fours', 'pescatarian menu', 'red mullet', 'michelin restaurant', 'barcelona', 'desserts', 'tourist trap', 'fine dining restaurants', 'dessert']"

Cala Joana,"Highly recommended. Everything was super delicious, very well cooked, and all the workers, even the cooks, are wonderful, even though they were inside, they helped me find the bathroom. The waiter who served us was super close and very nice, a loving person, advising him so that my bag wouldn't be stolen and what to order.
We ordered gazpacho, seafood rice that had a lot of flavor and was delicious and the sausage was delicious too.
After dessert there are some homemade ones that looked very good, the ones I saw and the chocolate mousse cake was very delicious.
Everything you ask for, they serve you very well.
To improve, I would only say that I like gazpacho with less vinegar but maybe it is a personal taste, but they could add less and offer whoever wanted more.
Thank you very much for such good work!",5 stars

LO Restaurant,"Summer. July 1st. I am surprised by how empty the restaurant is since we are a few meters from Bogatell beach and we are in the holiday period. I choose a salmon tatare, it was terrible, it was pure brine. For dessert, a chocolate coulant that turns out to be a round, tasteless, dry and burning cake where there was no trace of chocolate fondant. The vanilla ice cream could be improved. The only good thing is the place and the air conditioning, large and luxurious spaces but very poorly managed, a shame.",2 stars

I didn't believe it because the stewardess only had a few units but Most of the time there are quite a few. I wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't been charged ‚Ç¨2 for a mini croissant.

But the grilled dishes here look and most likely taste amazing. If you decide to give a try to Pierna de Cornero or just ask for a good steak, you won't be disappointed. Special recommendation for starters: Pimientos del padron (green paprika grilled). Its not expensive, the portion  is super generous and tastes really well.",5 stars

La Mal Dita Restaurant,Today some friends and I ate there and it was excellent. The food was very good and with very good presentation. Excellent treatment. Everything very clean. The only thing I've missed are some cushions for those of us who sit on the wooden seats. 100% recommended. Thank you.,5 stars

La Mal Dita Restaurant,"I ate with some friends and it was great, the service, both from the waiter and the cooks, was great.
All very good. Very nice place.
Just a small suggestion... some cushions for those who sit on the wooden benches would be great to put on your back.",5 stars
La Mal Dita Restaurant,"Establishment strategically located next to the Marina metro station, ideal for regaining strength before or after enjoying a show at the Auditori or the TNC or before delving into the extensive nightlife offer in Poblenou. The exquisite food is prepared at a bar in front of diners and the atmosphere is informal and stylish. The service is attentive although the kitchen hours are somewhat foreign to local users, as it closes at 9:30 p.m., a time when many locals have not yet thought about having dinner, much less on the eve of a holiday. It's what globalization brings... But it is undoubtedly highly recommended. Let's see if with everyone's influx we can extend the schedule ;-)",4 stars

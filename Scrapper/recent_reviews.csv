Vinitus,Worst service ever. Got ignored at the queue when I was asking for a table for one. The staff went in to check for the availability of tables but no one came back to me after waiting for more than half an hour.
Vinitus,"The food was spectacular, especially the sirloin with foie and the carabinero croquettes. The creme brulee is also worth trying. The service was excellent. The only bad thing is that it is quite noisy. You have to go early as you cannot reserve and there is usually a queue."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"Very good cuisine and service With the place full of people, some tables seem very close We will repeat with tapas"
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"It wasnt as good as I expected. The ingredients were fresh and tasty, but I cant really find anything thats better than other tapas restaurants. Of course he was kind."
Vinitus,The Camembert skewers and torrija cremeda were amazing!  The serving staff worked very well together.
Vinitus,Delicious food. I ate lobster and asparagus. Both are delicious.
Vinitus,"Great flavors, fresh products, rating 10/10, if someone is looking for fresh seafood, fish, squid, delicious paela, I recommend it"
Vinitus,Great food and great service. I especially loved the cod with honey aioli and the goat cheese salad. The beef and foie montadito is also highly recommended.
Vinitus,Very nice tapas bar. Several places inside and outside. Service is very quick and attentive. The tapas are very tasty. The prawns in olive oil particularly stood out. The chicken croquettes were also delicious. Prices were also very fair. Furnishings are modern and chic.
Vinitus,"Very good option to snack and be able to talk at the same time, good quality and price"
Vinitus,The food is excellent and the service very attentive. The foie is delicious and the Torrija de Santa Teresa divine.
Vinitus,"Visited on Sunday around 1pm. There were about 5 groups waiting, and since the store is large, the rotation was quick and we were shown around in about 10.15 minutes. I went there wanting to eat paella, and the lunch was just one type of paella (chicken) of the day. It had plenty of bone-in chicken and was delicious. Churros and chocolate sauce seem to be popular in Spain    so I ordered it.It wasnt too sweet or heavy and was easy to eat. The coconut pudding I ordered with it was a little sweet, but it was delicious! Next time I want to go eat lobster paella!"
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,The food was actually a bit too greasy. The specialty of the day was paella lobster and the rice was in a layer of oil. Maybe thats how it should be.
Vinitus,High quality ingredients.. Delicious and fabulous food. Food : 5/5
Vinitus,"Nice place in a pleasant area, with amazing food. You dont book, you queue and you understand why."
Vinitus,Good price and quality. A BIG line.
Vinitus,
Vinitus,As always exceptional food Parking: Sometimes difficult to park
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"Everything I ate in Barcelona was delicious, but I cant forget the shock of my first bite here... I went in mid-March and it was off-season, so I hardly saw any Koreans, but it was a taste that Koreans would like. The famous honey cod surprisingly had a texture similar to scallops, and it smelled a bit like fish when you first took a bite. I thought the white part on top was cheese, but it tasted like cream, and the red part tasted like marinated tomatoes. But since the fish has a sweet taste, people may have different preferences haha; But for me, everything was really delicious. I will go again when I come to Barcelona again!! I recommend it!"
Vinitus,"Good service. The tapas and sangria are good, but there are a lot of people and quite noisy"
Vinitus,Great service. Food was tasty.
Vinitus,
Vinitus,I went at 9 oclock on the weekend and there were a lot of people! I waited for about an hour before eating. The food generally comes out quickly and is delicious. I ordered two pieces of honey cod! I felt sad after eating one...
Vinitus,"I cannot and do not find a negative. Impeccable service, amazing food quality, super honest prices."
Vinitus,A great restaurant to taste Spanish food! The waiting queue is worthy. 100 recommended! Food
Vinitus,"Although reservations are not accepted and there may be a line to get in, the wait is worth it. Everything excellent"
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"The food, service, and ambience here is so good we came back twice during our stay in Barcelona, once for lunch and once for dinner. The food is cooked perfectly. The grilled razor clams and squid were noticeably more tender than the ones we had at Mercado de La Boqueria."
Vinitus,"Excellent service, delicious food and good price,  25 per person and I will repeat."
Vinitus,A couple of very tasty beers and the montaditos were delicious and at a very good price. Very friendly in the service too. Truly recommended.
Vinitus,"A restaurant that worth a good rating. The lobster rice is with right amount of moist, seasoning and portion. Fried artichokes pairs well with the copa beer, and the torrija is heavenly. Lovely service from the staff! Will definitely visit again. Only waited 20 mins for 2 pax (visited at 1.50pm on a Saturday)."
Vinitus,"Aren t I Korean? Among Spanish dishes, honey cod is a must-eat. I went, but it was really salty. The other food was just the same. Dont expect much"
Vinitus,"Nice atmosphere, fast service, great food prepared on the spot with prime ingredients. Absolutely recommended! Food"
Vinitus,"Although frequented by many mass tourists, they manage to maintain a friendly, professional environment and good products."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"This was the first place we went to eat that was recommended to us by a girl near where we stayed. Super super delicious food, extremely friendly waiters!!!! Super recommended, really!!! Sometimes it happens to us that since we are tourists we are not treated well because they think they will not see us again but in this place, although there were many people in line, we were treated like at home."
Vinitus,Too long for a table and once they were served they had to be reminded about the food. Also everything is very rich
Vinitus,"The food and atmosphere a 10!!!! We ate very, very well and at very reasonable prices. It doesnt surprise me that the restaurant is always full and very successful! We will return for sure!!"
Vinitus,"Vinitus is the ultimate spot for a top-notch tapas experience! With a diverse selection of delicious small plates, its the perfect place to indulge in Spains culinary delights. Dont miss out on this amazing dining experience!"
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"Someone who has tatoos at his arm, was very kind. He was the most kind person to me. Food was delicious. Moods waa perfect. Everything was perfect. Price was reasonable at barcelona where is crowded by foreigners"
Vinitus,"This tapas shop is located on a street close to Passeig de Gracia. I think its a chain of other famous tapas restaurants. Its a hit! The mate shellfish, patata bravas, and fried seafood are all delicious and suitable to start with. The foie gras and sirloin pintxos are rich and a bit pricey, but well worth it. The mini hamburgers are also delicious. For dessert, I had three different textures of chocolate, which were very delicious. It looks beautiful and the quality is satisfactory."
Vinitus,"Amazing flare, great service! Food was delicious!"
Vinitus,"Its very unfriendly and the atmosphere is messy. Its not that it doesnt taste good, but its definitely not a place where youll have to endure the long lines, prices, and service. Its not because Im busy, its a time when there arent many people around, but Im having a good time with my co-workers and Im showing a lot of dislike when taking orders. The honey cod is not that good, so go somewhere else."
Vinitus,I like the lively atmosphere.
Vinitus,Delicious tapas at a good price
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"The food is great, the servers are great, everything is perfect."
Vinitus,"Impressive, all of us who were there left delighted, we will return another day, the food was very good, the service was impeccable, a ten"
Vinitus,"Absolut must when you are in Barcelona. Staff, food, and atmosphere are incredible. Sit at the bar and com early, before 7pm on a weekday even earlier on Fridays and Saturdays. Vinitus is very popular."
Vinitus,Food : 5/5 |
Vinitus,"Valeur sure. Dommage que lon ne puisse pas reserver car tres bonnes tapas simples mais toujours efficace, bonne maitrise de la cuisson des fruits de mer. Recommandations: montadito de gambas y calamar, la tapa de arroz a midi, les chips dartichaut si cest la saison. La tapa de noix de saint jacques et crevettes. Un delice. Dessert: ganache de chocolat huile dolive et sel. Une tuerie."
Vinitus,Tres bonne cuisine
Vinitus,Tapas chers et pas terrible. 5 crevettes pour 10 euros. On nous a installe au sous-sol ou c etait sombre.
Vinitus,"We received an indication to go to Vinitus. Getting there, we waited around 30 minutes, but it was worth it. We ordered several types of tapas, all with good presentation and great flavor. The service was also very good. Oh, and theres also that delicious dessert, I dont remember the name, but its the first on the menu. We recommend!"
Vinitus,"Extraordinary, delicious and reasonably priced."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"great pleace to eat tapas, sea foods. good bear and sangria. strongly recommended."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"I went because it was famous for honey cod. The cod was really delicious, and I additionally ordered octopus dish and grilled shrimp skewers, but I liked the octopus better when I ate it at another restaurant the day before. The restaurant was very spacious and comfortable, and the staff were friendly."
Vinitus,They are not kind and fair for the table reservation. Meals are not delicious... TOTALLY RUDE
Vinitus,"Nice selection of tapas, and fun sitting at the bar to see them prep the food."
Vinitus,Very good value for money considering the good location.
Vinitus,Good value for money

Vinitus,"If you are Korean, go to Vinitus! It really suits the taste of honey cod and the staff are all friendly."
Vinitus,"It is delicious, always full, cheap, but the quality, plastic table and chair, on the verge of wholesale food."
Vinitus,"The freshest tapas place in town, all seafood was served perfect! Would love to recommend friends to come."
Vinitus,I understand why there are so many customers. I am satisfied with the food and atmosphere. Even service^^
Vinitus,"Our favourite tapas in Barcelona. Excellent choice of dishes especially seafood, all prepared freshly, great ambience & friendly servers"
Vinitus,"Very nice local restaurant. I dont know if you can reserve but today, Friday night, it was full of people and waiting at the door with names written down until the girl calls you to sit at the table. The truth is that they prepare some dishes in front of you very well. Nice decoration."
Vinitus,Exquisite tapas. For the waiter Marc a rating of 10.
Vinitus,"Avoid. Normally I do not give 1 star as there is always some quality that is worth more. But this place is horrible in all ways. First, food is totally not worth it. They take the meaning of tapas to extreme that the portion is all size of small appetizer. They have the easy tourist scam of only providing lobster paella which again is waste of money. It does not taste like lobster and the lobster was not fresh. (Image) Worst part is the service. There are many filipino servers who are good as gossiping and bad at serving. The service totally ruins the whole mood."
Vinitus,"Its really so delicious...!!! Honey cod really has a crazy, crazy, crazy taste!!! Even after eating to our hearts content with four women, we only ended up paying 140 euros. Yaho"
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"The cuisine is good, elaborate tapas and successful dishes but there are a lot of people, a lot of tourists (it must be in the guides) you have to wait in line to get in and it is a very large place, two floors."
Vinitus,"In the meantime, I traveled to Lisbon, Porto, Seville, and Ronda and came to Barcelona. The most delicious food I had... I sat at the bar and the male staff member, who had years of experience, was very quick and friendly. There seems to be a reason why things are going well..."
Vinitus,Great restaurant with great cuisine and various excellently made dishes. Highlights include their prawn and squid skewers and their torrijas.
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"We like it a lot and we always try to go, the only bad thing is that they dont reserve and at rush hour you can wait 45 minutes in an easy queue. The food was quite good, quality/price very good and the waiters were very attentive and friendly. Nothing is ever missing. I recommend the lobster rice, fried eggs and sirloin with foie among many others."
Vinitus,Beautiful restaurant and delicious vegetarian dishes
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"Good restaurant for tapas or a meal to share. Very friendly service despite the number of people there. I think it is not possible to reserve, it is better to go there early. The food is very tasty and well presented. The right house wine."
Vinitus,"The seafood served weren t fresh. Ordered mussels and shrimp, and kept vomiting after that"
Vinitus,Delicious tapas! One of the best places to be in Barcelona! The only thing is that they dont accept reservations.

La Flauta,"Perfect place! We were there 5 times during our vacation, and we were delighted every time! Great prices, fast and friendly service, plenty of seating. I recommend trying the tomato bread and carbonara, it s simply top notch, although everything we tried was delicious!"
La Flauta,Good food and good service
La Flauta,"Food is very average, staff service and attitude is bad. Servers are very unprofessional and the atmosphere appeals to be a classy restaurant, but in reality feels more like a family restaurant."
La Flauta,"This place sells the same menu as Vinitus, but the honey cod here feels a bit more authentic. The honey cod, foie gras steak, and clams were all satisfactory, and the staffs response was also excellent."

La Flauta,Excellent food and attention. Highly recommended
La Flauta,"It is a highly recommended place to stay at any time of the day. In addition to the lunch menu, they have a large selection of tapas to share. The terrace is small but very comfortable and welcoming. Friendly staff fast and efficient. Very good value for money"
La Flauta,"Amazing tapas, everything we tried was absolutely delicious and fresh, also the dessert. If we had more time in Barcelona, wed definitely try it again"

La Flauta,The portions are not big and the price is very reasonable. Two or three people can try 6-10 dishes. No need to worry about scams and prices.

After about an hour we went out and there was a waiting queue of about 30 meters outside the venue, they dont accept reservations but sooner or later they give everyone a seat. Its worth it both for the dishes and the very low prices."

La Flauta,"The only restaurant I visited twice in 8 days in Spain. I dont think there is another Hyeja restaurant like this in Barcelona. The menu is almost the same as Vinitus and Ciudad Condal, but the prices are cheaper and the portions are larger! There are a lot of people, so you have to wait in line after 8 oclock (you can be attacked by crazy cigarette smoke while waiting in line), and its very busy, so I cant say the staff are friendly, but if you eat giant honey cod, youll change your mind! Its much bigger than other places, and they have aioli and honey sprinkled generously.. Its busy, so Koreans like it when things are done in a hurry. The speed of menus and calculations is almost like that of Koreans. You might want to go there at least once, right? Spaniards do it before dinner. Go early~"
La Flauta,"Food is delicious... I just wish I could cook, not run a business."

La Flauta,"All the staff were very kind. We went there around five oclock and there was no queue. We were worried that we wouldnt know what to order after looking at the names of the dishes, so we cut out a picture of the picture menu of what we wanted to eat and directly asked the staff to order according to the picture. The total meal for two people was 86 euros. It was very filling, the dining atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. It was the most delicious meal we have had in Spain so far. I highly recommend the honey cod, foie gras steak, octopus feet, bamboo fungus and grilled shrimp. Every dish is made with care, and the fruit wine is also delicious. Overall, there is nothing to fault. The only thing that I think is better is the stew. As for rice, maybe we eat too much rice in Taiwan, and the store also provides bread, so the starch can be replaced. Conclusion: This is a store that I am willing to return and recommend to others"
La Flauta,The restaurant was busy. The foie with beef steak was average in flavor. The grilled seafood platter tasted good but was a bit pricey. The honey codfish was way too salty. Overall it was ok but I wouldnt come back

La Flauta,Good and varied food and good service
La Flauta,"La Flauta was recommended to us by a friend from Barcelona and we understood why right when we entered the place. You can see how fresh the ingredients are on display at the entrance. We arrived at around 6:30pm and did not wait, but the queue quickly built up and by 8 it was huge. Arrive early! For food, we loved the burrata, the fried aubergine, huevos cabreros, and the fritata mista. For dessert, the Sta. Theresa is so good we ended up asking for another one. Service could be more attentive however."
La Flauta,Great food!!!
La Flauta,"I found a better tapas place than Vinitus. I was a bit shocked to see a Korean review on Google, but I was glad I saw it later.. (It was a photo of B appearing in the store) Its been a few months so I guess Ive been paying attention~ I waited for the food I ordered, but all the food was really delicious. In particular, the honey cod had a sweeter taste than Vinitus, and they gave me a lot of tomatoes, so I was happy       Even the dishwashing shot was certified!"
La Flauta,"Absolutely phenomenal in every regard. We were a foursome and dined here twice and ordered a huge variety of tapas along with red and white sangria and eight different dessert options and everything was delicious. You can literally throw a dart at their menu and order whatever the dart chooses for you. Service was prompt and friendly, prices were ridiculously affordable (never more than 20 euros per person. Suggest you make reservations or arrive before 8 pm or be ready for a long line. Highest recommendation."
La Flauta,Very nice place. Elegant. The welcome was most pleasant. It made the wait a lot less boring. Excellent dishes.
La Flauta,"No matter where you look at it, the service is amazing, the food is amazing, a 10, thank you for everything."

La Flauta,The food is very good and the staff is extremely friendly and efficient.
La Flauta,"This restaurant, as well as those that belong to the same ownership, has an exceptional tapas menu. The menu is the same in all restaurants. You cannot book and you can easily wait from 30 minutes to over an hour. Times to avoid are 7.30pm to 10.30pm. Before or after you generally dont expect more than 10 Minutes. But its absolutely worth it."

La Flauta,"Excellent address, cuisine in front of you. Only one downside: the tapas arrive one after the other too quickly. Its a shame from this point of view."
La Flauta,
La Flauta,"Tastes are terrific! but services are not great as other busy restaurants. I got there around 1:30 pm, and there were many people waiting in a line, but I was a single and was serviced without waiting. I tried honey cods and anchovies with a clara and a sangria. They are all great, one of the best! Actually, I ordered Tinto de Verano, but they brought sangria."
La Flauta,"Great!! I love La Flute and all its menu! Very fresh product, well cooked and at a very competitive price!!"

La Flauta,
La Flauta,Arrived before 6pm and there was no queue. The service was fast and the food was excellent. Definitely recommend going to this restaurant.
La Flauta,"He has lost a lot. We went to eat after a long time. They served us poorly, in a hurry and the waitress made a mistake. When telling him about the error, he tells us in a bad way that he has already gone through it and that they are going so fast that changing it is a problem for him, we ignore it. The food... rich but fair and cold. The fish was good and well cooked (although it was not what I had ordered), supposedly accompanied with vegetables, it only had four pieces of zucchini (thats zucchini, not vegetables in the plural). Despite the initial rush, it took them 45 minutes to bring the dessert, creme brulee, cold of course. Again with the poor treatment of the staff to whom we had to request dessert on three occasions."
La Flauta,"I found this to be more delicious than the Vinitus honey cod. The honey was richer, the cod was saltier, so it was the ultimate sweet-salty dish, and it was even more delicious because there was something white covering the cod slightly!!! I would like to say that this is the honey cod of my life. I also ate Bolognese pasta, but while I was in Paris and Basel, it occurred to me that Korean pasta tastes better. For me, it felt a little less salty and milder in taste compared to the pasta I ate in Korea!"
La Flauta,"On the recommendation of one of my friends we chose La Flauta for dinner and the truth is that we were very satisfied in general: I recommend you go with time and calmly because there are very long lines of about 30-45 minutes but it is worth it. (If you are not passing through you can reserve by calling without any problem) From the first moment, even though it was packed and it is still a place where people are in constant rotation, the treatment was very good. We ate a little bit of everything (croquettes, seafood, omelette, piccolos, angry eggs, hamburgers...) to add some hiccups, the croquettes arrived cold at the table and they immediately provided a solution to the problem, a detail on your part. A highlight of the restaurant is that it has two very well structured floors. - Would you recommend this site? If so, perfect to spend a pleasant time with your loved ones. Kid-friendliness: Yes, it just so happened that on the first floor there were several families with strollers."

La Flauta,"This was a recommendation from my Uncle who is a regular visitor and has friends in the city. We enjoyed it so much that we came back two nights in a row. We visited with our 2.5 year old son and the staff were very friendly. The food was great, quick service and all freshly prepared. I recommend the croquettes. Good value and great atmosphere, well priced too. Kid-friendliness: We dined with our 2.5 year old son. The staff were very kind and accommodating"

Goiko,"Very good service from Juli, very kind and very attentive, not like the girl at the bar who, in addition to being rude, has been a despot. If she doesnt like working, she shouldnt do it, but she shouldnt pay for it with others."
Goiko,The burger was delicious and Isabellas service was impeccable.
Goiko,"Delicious the most smash! Isabella attended us, super friendly and very good treatment"

Todo estaba muy bueno pero la actitud le la chica que nos cobro  pesima. Vegetarian options: Rffy Parking: Hhh"
Goiko,"Un servicio inmejorable. Tanto la comida como el trato al cliente de 10, en especial Oriana, estuvo en todo momento al tanto de nuestra comanda, resolutiva y muy agradable. Repetiremos sin duda. Parking: Parking"

Goiko,"The burger I had was just a work of art, so fresh and juicy, the potatoes with the local sauce were quite good as well. The service is nice, they speak quite okay English so we got both explained and recommended what were eating. The atmosphere makes it look like youre not even in Barcelona :) just a nice place overall"
Goiko,"A very nice girl named Oriane treated us very well, a very good place, with excellent food and very good treatment."
Goiko,
Goiko,"The food for the price is not bad. Fair. Horrible service. I went to celebrate my daughters birthday and the manager (or person who served us) was very unpleasant in her treatment. I asked him about things in the letter that I didnt understand and his answer was that it was all in the letter without even looking me in the eyes. Maybe the girl was having a bad day, and we can all have it, but she treated me with an air of superiority for asking about things she didnt understand in the letter. The childrens menu is good but dont even think about asking them anything."
Goiko,
Goiko,Nice staff although we asked to change tables since it was very cold at the entrance every time they opened the door and they wouldnt let us. They said they had turned up the heating... but every time the door opened we were cold and ate unhappily... The food is delicious but
Goiko,"A great option to eat one of the best burgers today. The DON VITO AND THE BB QUEEN are incredible, very worth it. What they should improve is the rest of the food, it is not at the level of the hamburgers and it is very noticeable. For example, pierce the teques with a fork and fry them, leaving them for at least 2 minutes. You will notice the difference. Which was also on point but memorable, even the French fries and Deluxe could be improved. In short, a decent site, if they improve the rest, they will definitely have more customers."
Goiko,
Goiko,
Goiko,"The bacon kebin was very good, and I really liked it and it was very good. Very good service and the burger was delicious. Very good food"
Goiko,fairly good
Goiko,
Goiko,incredible

Goiko,"We went to Goiko for a walk to San Juan with a promo I have for a second burger at 50%, valid from Monday to Sunday, it literally says it on the Goiko promotional card. Well, once the order was placed, the machine gave them problems accepting the promo and a worker told us that this promo is from Monday to Friday, which is why it did not happen; despite literally saying  from Monday to Sunday at any time, before March 15"
Goiko,"I always go to this place, since I am from the area. They always give me super good service and especially Juliana. Vegetarian options: You can customize all the burgers, it is greatly appreciated. And sometimes when the order has not been taken well, they have made the burger again or compensated. So a 10, you can come with a group of people with different diets and all enjoy delicious burgers."

Goiko,We have known this goiko for a long time! We went on Sunday night and everything was great! Very good burgers and exquisite treatment from the staff!
Goiko,"Hello, good evening, yesterday my daughter went to dinner with 10 friends and the girl who served them treated them very badly, first because of the number of people, which was more than 10, then since there were 2 left to arrive, she told them that if she didnt arrive In 20 minutes everyone had to leave, I work in a restaurant and I know what its like to serve customers and I have never seen worse treatment. . I have never been, but I see that I never go. If Mr. Goicoechea knows this, he will surely not like it, seeing what he did with so much effort and some bad employees made him lose."
Goiko,
Goiko,"Axel I met you today, but I will never forget you. Raise your salary #justiceforaxel"

Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"We had come for the photos of the food but it turns out that they told us that they changed their menu and they almost dont have anything similar. These are the dishes we ordered, the salty ones were quite average but the Pancake was good. We were a little disappointed and the waiter was a little passive. Well decorated place, but the price-service does not convince us very much."
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"The description of the food and the actual dish you receive are different. The presentation of the dishes is beautiful, but the taste and quality are so-so  Not a bad atmosphere, but could find better places around."
Brunch & Cake,"Very disappointing brunch, especially considering the high ranking it has on google. Very poor quality of food, dirty toilets, bad aesthetics. Totally not recommended."
Brunch & Cake,"- They have a waiting sign and obviously I placed myself there, but no one was paying attention or telling me to come in, so after a while I sat down at a table inside. - We thought they closed at 5pm, but it turns out its only the kitchen. We came for pancakes that we didnt get to try. - The letter was hard to download because the link went to Google Drive and it didnt open on all mobile phones. Personally, I asked for the mobile next door. - The girl asked us which language to use for the order, that if Spanish, English... after ordering in Catalan, it turns out that she has only been here for a month. We were sorry. - Behind us, there were a couple of employees ringing a very loud bell and moving glass glasses up and down, probably for cleaning. For a small cafe type place, you couldnt have a normal conversation with so much fuss. - When we received the order, we thought that they had not understood us because of the language. The chocolate cake and chocolate cupcake were not so. On the menu it only said chocolate cake, not that it had raspberry jam or similar. The cupcake was not chocolate. It was a bland base with a nice chunk of ferrero rocher type chocolate on top. That cream was good, but not what I asked for. The people next door had the same thing with the cake, so we found out that our order was like that, it wasnt the language. At least the pancakes had a clear description. I am a person who liked honesty. - Summary: I stopped in a place for pancakes that I couldnt try and paid 11 euros for two items that were not what I ordered. - By the way, I still dont understand the grandmothers motto. Out of place with experience."
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,I will repeat
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"Mediocre influencer food and focuses on aesthetics rather than the food itself. If you are looking for a place for a photo shoot and to make content, it is the place for you, but it is not my first choice for having real good food."
Brunch & Cake,Cute place. Large portions. Great food. Food could be warmer.
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"Everything was wonderful. Food fantastic. We had tap water which they charged $2 for, in Paris the tap water is free. Thats the only thing we were surprised about but it was still a fantastic service and food."
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"I had brunch at this restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. First of all, the place has been remodeled and looks very inviting. Its design makes me want to stay inside and relax. Another positive aspect is the staff who work at this restaurant. Everyone was very nice to me, especially my waiter, who spoke good English, by the way. I appreciated that the menu offered a variety of food, including a few interesting options. I personally ordered shakshuka with added cheese, and it was absolutely delicious! Additionally, the way they presented/decorated this dish made me extremely happy! For dessert, I ordered a Ferrero Rocher cupcake. Unfortunately, it was slightly disappointing because the cupcake was somewhat dry, but fortunately, the Ferrero Rocher cream was very fresh and delicious. I found the prices at this restaurant to be reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch/brunch."
Brunch & Cake,"Very good, excellent service and everyone was very friendly. I highly recommend it."
Brunch & Cake,"I liked everything the food, the service, the atmosphere. The waiter helped me to choose  according to my preferences. And the dish was super good. I also like coffee here , I tried vanilla and matcha latte, both good. Actually their matcha is the best one in my life."
Brunch & Cake,Best brunch in Barcelona! The service was wonderful and the food was divine. I wish it wasn t my last day here so I could come back again!
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,I am impressed with this place. The food and atmosphere were great and the staff extremely friendly. I would visit again! 100/10.
Brunch & Cake,"The atmosphere was great, very Instagram friendly with great staff. The food here was thought very disappointing. I got the croque maddam and since I sat outside the bread got cold in a minute and the taste of cheese, truffle and bacon wasn t of great quality -12.90 . The beetroot latte was fine but nothing exceptional."
Brunch & Cake,"We were three people, we had to wait a long time because it was full. However, all the food was good. The place is quite small."
Brunch & Cake,Everything was amazing
Brunch & Cake,"We found the cafe by chance. The service was very nice but the waiters gave us the feeling that they were taking on as many customers as possible and processing everyone as quickly as possible. Unfortunately the food wasnt good at all. We ordered the  Epic Avocado Toast  3 times, which really didn t taste good and also totally upset my stomach and I had to lie in bed for the rest of the day. My other friends also immediately noticed that something was wrong with the bread and one of them couldnt eat it at all."
Brunch & Cake,"Food was lacking in flavor. I got scrambled eggs on toast with avocado and bacon which is hard to mess up, but the entire thing was pretty bland. Same with my boyfriend s dish (protein bowl). I got an ice latte and it was served frozen, like a slushy (it was fine, but in case that s not what you re expecting). No wait time because we got there at 9:00am. Staff was not the friendliest. I wish we skipped this place, it s overhyped."
Brunch & Cake,"Good food, good desserts and good tea! Difficult to find this combo in Barcelona."
Brunch & Cake,"Very good food, super attentive and fast service, they have been very friendly at all times."
Brunch & Cake,Jelly was so attentive & wonderful!
Brunch & Cake,Sarah was a great waitress! Great place!

Brunch & Cake,Very good service and spectacular food
Brunch & Cake,Very good and very friendly
Brunch & Cake,"A spectacular breakfast, very good service!"
Brunch & Cake,"My purse was stolen when I was eating INSIDE the restaurant and they didnt let us see the cameras Although the food is good, the safety is not there."
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"One of the best brunch we ever had. Extremely nice and efficient staff. The food was absolutely delicious and came out perfect We were greeted and seated when we arrived, and given a QR code to check out the menu. A waitress took our order and gave recommendations based on our dietary restrictions. The atmosphere was clean, cozy, and comfortable. There was also outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy the nice weather. The food was fresh & servings were more than enough for both of us. If you are debating between brunch places, definitely don t miss out on this place!"
Brunch & Cake,Super tasty and beautifully made!
Brunch & Cake,Nice and cozy place with a tasty food for brunch. Everyone can find something here. I tried shakshuka and immunity juice( carrot ginger orange mint). Was very good. And not typical serving of shakshuka ( served inside the freshly baked bread) was as well nice:)
Brunch & Cake,Everything was great from the food to the staff!
Brunch & Cake,
Brunch & Cake,"Good place for a quick bite! I ordered the burrito and it was tasty, lacked a bit of flavor but it was good. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was very cozy! I would definitely come back to try more dishes!"

Brunch & Cake,"Good atmosphere, magnificent food and exceptional staff treatment. We will return."

Brunch & Cake,"I really liked the food 10/10 but I even ordered this sweet to take away, because I loved it, its like breaking a diet or giving you a great taste and the cream is enough to lick your plate."
Brunch & Cake,"I went there a week ago to eat with my partner and everything was very delicious, the service was very friendly and fast. The place is beautiful both outside and inside. Its not the first time shes gone but I have and we both really liked it. I hope to return there soon in a few weeks!"

We divided the portions among 3 people, they being quite large. and the piece de resistance was the seafood paella, incredible, the best Ive eaten so far. Along with this paella, Giovanni recommended an excellent sweet wine. Our first evening in Barcelona could not have been better. Thank you, Giovanni!"

Vivo Tapas,"Place located near the Diagonal, very particular and scenographic in its furnishings. It is a mix between cocktail bar and tapas with typical Iberian proposals. They welcome you with a glass of bubbles from seasoned olives. Quite varied menu with dishes for all budgets, of good quality. Well-developed wine and cocktail list. The evening certainly does much more for the environment than lunch. Vegetarian options: Next to each dish there is a symbol that refers to vegetarian dishes"

Vivo Tapas,I had a good meal time. Im very satisfied with the taste and appearance:)Thanks you Giovanni Food

Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Loved this place. I highly recommend it if you are in the area.  We fond it randomly- not planning on a big meal Al it drinks and tapas. However, we ended ordering more than we needed. We loved the pizza - crust was spectacular as was the cheese.  Cocktails were very well made and good Italian wine selection by the glass ."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,A very good and recommended Italian!!! Whether you do the menu ( 16) or you eat a la carte... Youll wear your boots!!! The quantity and quality are very good and the price is reasonable given the quality of what they serve!!! The pastuc coulant is spectacular... And some ravioli with pepper sauce and pine nuts are excellent!!!

Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"The food is delicious, whatever you order, everything is fresh and delicious, the only downside is that the background music was too loud and made chatting a bit difficult. Remember to reserve a table if you go on the weekend"

Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Personne a laccueil antipathique au possible. Pizza passable. Je ne recommande pas.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,All very good! Highly recommend the nutella pizza for dessert.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Pedimos una pizza carbonara y una cuatro quesos por Glovo. Gran desilusion, el guanchale de la carbonara era solo grasa nada de carne, el queso no llegaba ni hasta los bordes solo masa. Y la cuatro quesos, con queso industrial y la pizza estaba llena de grasa vieja del horno, un horror, sentimos nuestro estomago acido. No pedimos nunca mas."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Very tasty, great service"

Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Good food, large portions, vegetarian options. Vegetarian options: Good options Food : 4/5 |"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Too much bustle of people, the tables are very close together, it seems like you are dining with the person next door, food and service very good. Parking: Impossible to park"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"There were people and the service was not excellent, but acceptable due to the volume of people. For the rest great, very good food!"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Excellent cuisine with a taste of traditional Italy.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"The attention and courtesy of the receptionist at this restaurant are simply incomparable. From the moment I arrived, I felt like a special guest thanks to their kindness and professionalism. And director David took my dining experience to the next level with his deep culinary knowledge and meticulous attention to every detail. Without a doubt, a culinary experience that I will recommend to all my friends and family."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,The salad was not bad and the spaghetti is supposed to come with truffles but there was none and it tasted ok. I had better Italian food in the Boston North End neighborhood. The service staff ignored you until you look around for someone. Perhaps I didn t order alcohol so my check wasn t big enough for better service.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Good Italian food, great atmosphere. Portion is good, slightly too much even. Consider sharing a dish if you re not feeling that hungry. The only not so great part was that the vile that was supposedly medium-rare felt very rare."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Thank you very much, very tasty, I will definitely come back!"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"We often visit this restaurant, as well as luigi at frances Macia. But this happened for the first time! There was very slow service! They didn t take our order for about 15 minutes, although the restaurant was almost empty. Then we waited a long time for our order. First there was a snack. We have been waiting for her for a very long time! Then they brought us pizza. Of course, the type of pizza did not affect the taste, but what is it? Do you think this is a normal type of dish in a restaurant? Is this how you treat your guests? Do you think its normal to serve this?! And the pizza was cold!!! I will definitely not return to this place! And on top of everything else, the glasses on the table were dirty!!! I dont know what happened and why the quality of this place has dropped so much. It is sad! But with this attitude, you will lose customers! And unfortunately, I had to delete my positive review and leave this one because it is unacceptable!"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"I have been to this establishment many times and most of the time the dishes were quite tasty. This time I ordered ravioli with mushrooms and truffle. Very tasty, perfect sauce and perfect proportions of mushrooms and cream. My friend ordered lasagne. And this dish really disappointed us. There was too little sauce and bacon was added to the meat in the lasagna. It was very strange and unaesthetic Terrible service!!!!!!We waited a long time for the waiter in an empty restaurant. And this is observed repeatedly The bill was brought on the third request! Horror! I dont want to come back here anymore"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"I stopped by because I happened to be nearby. Atmosphere service food I was satisfied. I had salad and tiramisu with a glass of wine. At the end, I gave the chupito to the guest at the table next to me. The customer next to me highly recommended the pizza, saying it was delicious. I brought some olives and they were so delicious. I was so surprised. I want to go again, if only for the olives."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Great food and good vibes
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"I have several positive points and other constructive criticism. Starting with the positive, if you like a good wine, the CA BIANCA Moscato dAsti is a 10/10, fruity and very fresh. The pumpkin ravioli is very good. Now the constructive criticism. The carbonara with truffle is not killer, we expected a less cloying flavor but it was good. The pizzas, without further ado, fall apart too much and have been difficult to eat. The gorgonzola risotto does not have a cheese flavor, I dont know if it was an oversight by the cook, but it only tasted like nuts if you took a piece. It is quite hot in the place and a lot of noise. Even so, we will return in other hours to see if we can improve the review. Thank you very much for your attention"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Food and service excellent although there was too much background noise.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"The best carbonara that I ever tried. Thanks all the team for the experience, above all at David the manager I come back 100% sure Food : 5/5"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,I went to eat with my children and my partner and the truth is we left super happy with the treatment of all the waiters. We will definitely return when we are in Barcelona.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,All very well. Friendly staff and good food Short waiting time compared to other restaurants
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Very good atmosphere, very delicious food, especially the very attentive staff"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Very good service from Sakil
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Nice place, very good food, fair prices A guarantee every time I go to Barcelona"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Bad experience. Pizza was burnt definitely too much, that took all the pizza taste. I wanted to tell it to waiter, but he didnt ask if everything is ok and also werent showin up until i finished and wanted to ask for check. Cause of this pizza ive had black dirt on my hands, so i decided to use a rest room. The rest room was also dirty, espacielly toilets."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Nice pasta but service attitude is terrible bad. I arrived with luggage and kindly ask for the corner seat (don t want to bother other people) , but the man looks like restaurant manager arranged me seat in the super middle of aisle. The most badly thing is they still running daily working like kitchen food delivery , wine refilled (which should be finished before open hours) at  the same time. Super uncomfortable and annoyed vibe !"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,All very rich
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Excellent place close to Barcelona centre with delicious linguini with shrimps in garlic, lime and pesto  Mamma Mia!!! Everything was tasty, atmospheric and quick. Will come back several times!"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Great place, great food, very delicious. I recommend it with all my hands."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Thank you for being considerate enough to allow me to sit at the bar table and eat even if I visited on the same day because I couldnt make a reservation. The food was very delicious too!!
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Beautiful!
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Reasonable food but the worst service we experienced in Barcelona. The staff are slow, rude and angry with you when they made a mistake. We had to ask 3 times for a drink because our waitress left work and didn t place our order. When we re-ordered, 20 minutes later it arrived and 99% someone spat in it. Don t go there if you want a calm and pleasant dining experience."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Tremendous pasta at a reasonable price.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"As always, perfection! Visited multiple times in Luigis ristorante restaurants, ate pizzas and pastas, and the whole family enjoyed every time! Every staff member worked so professionally, but also with smile and little humor! House gave us little starters, and also little dessert."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Enjoyable meal in a very busy restaurant. Would be a go to spot for us in our home town.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"I do not recommend. I went with my wife on 02/23, at 8:50 pm. We didnt have a reservation and we were treated very poorly by the receptionist. When telling us that there would be no table available until 10:30 pm, the receptionist did not allow us to wait to enjoy tapas or drinks, dismissing us with a look of few friends. If the receptionist represents the image of the establishment, then the establishment is terrible in treating customers."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,I found snail in my salad.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"I called and made a reservation at the restaurant just 1 hour in advance. The place was full, however, everything we ordered was served quickly. I found the place noisy. The menu is very extensive, the food is delicious and the ingredients are of good quality. I recommend."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"High quality Italian. The place is very nice. The service is good, they are fast, and helpful. The food is quality, with authentic Italian ingredients. The desserts are a delight. The detail (Im not going to say what it is) is very good. I will definitely repeat. The price is reasonable Dietary restrictions: Allergens, well indicated on the menu."

Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"While visiting Barcelona I had the chance to have dinner in this place. I didnt have reservation and due to that I have waited 15 minutes for a table. They have big menu with a lot of choices. I ordered pizza and to my taste it was nice, however the pasta that my boyfriend had was far from the carbonara he always orders. The place and service are nice but we found better food in other italian restaurants."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Pizza was great feel in italy
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"We ordered 2 Luigi pizzas and a spaghetti carbonara, everything was great but the spaghetti had pepper, which was a problem for the child. It was communicated and the employee was super attentive, congratulations to the staff! Panna Cotta and Tiramisu from another world!!"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Delicious Italian food! The pasta with salmon and asparagus is delicious! The attention of 10
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Excellent
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Fast central location and good food . One of those with a real 3-course menu. Right price. Always open!!! It doesnt fail and a very good terrace
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Very good experience, especially with Josue, a super friendly waiter. Food"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Very friendly employees. The menu is in Spanish and English. Before the meal there was a bowl of marinated olives. Three small pieces of cake were served with the espresso. The toilet is on the ground floor. A cozy restaurant.
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Everything excellent!
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,Very good everything
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"We took the lunch menu. The truth is that it is super complete, with many options and very cheap. Plus the food was very good and they were super friendly. I had to leave the table early and they gave me the second dish to take away. I give it a 10!! I just needed some salt"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"We were there for the period of a fair and I must say that we found a bit of our Naples, Truly delicious pizza, special thanks to AUGUSTO the Pizzaiolo who was truly the best with the Pizzas, as well as being friendly and very kind"
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,"Even though I went at the stated opening time, I was told there was still time to wait. The response was that it was too early for lunch. The food is average. I cant recommend it as it doesnt seem friendly to tourists. It was 12:03 at 15 of January when I arrived at your restaurant l had to wait outside even though it was cold.There is a lunch menu which Iknow,Ididnt get lunch menu . I got only A la carte menu because I am a tourist, this is discrimination.Japanese dont ever look down on foreign tourists."
Luigi Ristorante - Roger de Lluria,unbeatable price quality. The pastas and sauces are delicious. They have an oven right there where they prepare the pizzas. The menu is very good. The service is very attentive and fast. Recommended Vegetarian options: It is not indicated on the menu but they also have several meatless dishes. Dietary restrictions: They have gluten-free pasta and some adapted dishes available.

La Pepita,
La Pepita,Staff are not nice. We had no reservation for dinner so we were treated rudely and we were given a tiny table in a corridor and were told we have to leave in an hour so we decided not to eat there.
La Pepita,"After a stroll around the neighborhood, we noticed the restaurant and decided to stop for lunch. It was very crowded when we arrived but we got seated at the bar very quickly. The service was friendly and efficient and the food was amazing! The green salad, the grilled octopus, the fried chicken, everything was perfectly seasoned and balanced. Best food experience in Barcelona so far. Would definitely recommend!"
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Tapas with a twist. Some hits and misses - food 4 stars. We felt rushed by the wait staff, understandable if there were people waiting to dine, but there were at least 2 free tables of the same size. Food"
La Pepita,Everything is excellent
La Pepita,"Innovative tapas, and incredible attention."
La Pepita,Very rich
La Pepita,
La Pepita,Amazing tapas and great service!
La Pepita,The best fried chicken. Garlic shrimp the worst
La Pepita,This is the first time I ve been this restaurant. The food taste soooooooo good and the people in here are so nice    They made a little birthday cake for me and also  sang birthday song for me with the customers   I m so happy and very surprised about all
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Discover a charming Catalan restaurant offering a variety of unique dishes for those seeking an adventure in culinary exploration. While the flavors were distinctive with each dish, they didnt quite reach exceptional heights, yet they were consistently intriguing: Carpaccio beef: 4/5 Sauteed beef: 3.5/5 Fried calamari: 4/5 Mousse au chocolat: 3.5/5 For those with an adventurous palate eager to broaden their culinary horizons, I highly recommend this establishment."
La Pepita,"5/5 tapas..delicious, fresh, not much pricy.. good portions also.. thank you a lot.."
La Pepita,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff."
La Pepita,"Always a good time at La Pepita, food is nice and affordable, the restaurant has a nice interior. It s nearly always packed, so make sure to reserve!"
La Pepita,"I went with high expectations. I tried many things, everything was served cold (the hot tapas), I only really liked 2, the fried chicken and the special meat from the nugget, it is a restaurant for tourists. And the attention is the worst part, they treat you very badly if you bother them, and they want to kick you out. The people who rate it very highly are because they have not tried really good tapas."
La Pepita,Yummy food and good vibes!
La Pepita,Really nice atmosphere and service. The food was good but I found the portions very small.
La Pepita,Lovely food and great service!
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Typical barcelona place open from 7pm to late evening, small with a long counter where you can eat tapas and drink something. delicious tapas, unfortunately you always have to book otherwise you risk never finding a place, better the day before. the fast and personal service is always available and very fast. in general we ate well, good and well-finished dishes, the only flaw was too noisy (after all, its Barcelona)"
La Pepita,"Good place, always full and amazing service. The food is decent but you can get better in less crowded place (less touristy), as ham was not the best quality and bread with tomato could be better as well."
La Pepita,Highly recommended tapas place in Gracia
La Pepita,Super fun place with amazing food and drinks
La Pepita,Amazing food in a very boisterous and fun atmosphere. These are small tapas style plates with large menu of delicious foods to try. Order several small plates to share. The energy and liveliness of this place is truly amazing. This restaurant was one of the highlights from our trip to Barcelona. We hope to be back one day.
La Pepita,"I really liked the place, everything I ate was 10/10, especially the popcorn ice cream! Interesting flavor"
La Pepita,"Food is great but the service came off as impatient. We dined on a Monday night and were just over an hour into our meal and chatting, during this time the server would whisk away plates as soon as we finished and had asked on three separate times if we were done with our plate, which we weren t and it felt like they were trying to rush us. I would understand if it was a busy evening, but the rush had died down and there were a couple of available tables around us. Worth to mention I also made a reservation and we had to wait about 20 mins as our table wasn t ready, and were very patient about it, so would have appreciated some patience back from the server."
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"From drinks to dessert, the staff and food quality were stellar. Our first great experience in the city!"
La Pepita,Delicious calamari and kimchi sauce. Very busy but short waiting time.
La Pepita,"Great food, good sized portions"
La Pepita,Casual and recommended atmosphere. Very well executed food. A must in grace
La Pepita,"Very delicious tapas, ideal for sharing and being able to try more dishes. Small place with little space."
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"It is a bit overrated place, IMHO, but the food is good and staff is super friendly and helpful. Better make a reservation. Otherwise, you can expect ~20 min of waiting outside"
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Best to reserve. Great food, nice service"
La Pepita,"Incredible - top food, top ambience, top service, its just an absolute pleasure to eat here - its my first time in Catalonia/Barcelona but its incredible and an absolute MUST to go to La Petita - Id love to come back!!!"
La Pepita,"Very cosy place with good food. Popular place, book in advance if you really want to eat here! But also very fast service so quick rotation of tables. Food"
La Pepita,It maintains its charm and good atmosphere despite being filled with tourists.
La Pepita,Perfect!
La Pepita,Outstanding! Came here on the recommendation of a friend and it did not disappoint. Service was excellent but food was spectacular. Fun atmosphere with walls signed by patrons.
La Pepita,"Weve eaten in many tapas bars, but this one is special. The tapas are newly interpreted and taste of the highest level. If you are looking for something special, you should stop by here. The location is also special, but I dont want to give too much away ;-) Be sure to reserve in advance, otherwise you wont get a seat."
La Pepita,Just go!! Just go!!   Amazing tapas...
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Funny, noisy artfull, good tapas and friendly"
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Tapas were delicious, especially the calamari and sea bass were excellent. Prices are also reasonable compared to the taste. The only negative thing I can say is that the tables were narrow and it was really difficult to move around to find your table due to the crowd."
La Pepita,Wonderful place try the aubergine
La Pepita,"The food was good, although based on the reviews I was expecting something more classic tapas style. The place is clearly focused on tourism, and that is why the dishes are more sophisticated. Right price."
La Pepita,Good fusion tapas
La Pepita,"While I got bored of tapas in general living in Barcelona, This place was definitely a very unique experience for us. Very tasty.!!! Portions were just perfect and service was great. Will def come again"
La Pepita,Great tapas and great wine. Reserve a table if you here with a bigger group.
La Pepita,"A place to go with friends or as a couple and enjoy good tapas and a good atmosphere. The food is delicious, although I dont think the desserts are its strong point, and the service is quite good."
La Pepita,On sest vraiment regale et le personnel est au top! Muchas gracias
La Pepita,"Amazing experience. We arrived without a reservation, we waited 5 minutes. and we sat at the counter straight away. The employee was responsive and efficient but not attentive or attentive. Another employee, on the contrary, was immensely attentive and careful, even removing a dessert from the bill that we ordered and didnt like. I recommend! Traditional place and appetizing food."
La Pepita,this place was something else! it was the best food I have tried and I cannot wait to return again !
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Pepita et mini Pepita 2 jours plus tard ! Personnel tres agreable, Tapas original : nous n avions jamais goute des calamars aussi bon !. Qualite/ prix super. Adresse a conseiller meme si il faut etre patient pour attendre une table Vegetarian options: Houmous, beignets d Aubergine"
La Pepita,
La Pepita,Great tapas bar in Barcelona!
La Pepita,"We really liked it here! From the moment we walked in, we were enchanted by the cozy yet stylish atmosphere. We tried tapas for the first time and they were a revelation for us, crafted with fresh, local ingredients with authentic Spanish flavors. The taste was so good! Definitely will go here again. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. With its charming ambiance, exceptional food quality, and good service, La Pepita is a true must visit in Barcelona. Five stars all the way!"

La Pepita,Such a cool and cozy place! Food was good. Fast service
La Pepita,"Unbeatable experience, the food was very delicious, the staff very attentive and a great atmosphere. Parking: Complicated"
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"A really good one. Spanish tapas with a wide variety and with a special touch. Croquettes, anchovies, beef tatar were amazing. Would definitely recommend for an authentic experience. Really quick service as well! You have to book en advance."
La Pepita,Aaaaamazing food! Atmosphere 10/10. It was a bit busy but we sat on the bar and the experience was even more authentic.
La Pepita,Tapas from heaven !
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"I hate to give a bad review because the staff is incredible. They went over and beyond during our visit and made it so enjoyable. Their energy is amazing. Unfortunately, the food lacks taste. We ordered around 7 different tapas and they were all very bland. The cocktails also had little alcohol. If the food was better I would rate 5 stars."
La Pepita,"I tried humus and it has no taste just artichoke on it, was nice also fried eggplants had really heavy bad taste on it and I think it is because of oil. This restaurant was the only place that I didn t like in Barcelona sorry."
La Pepita,"I went years ago and it was one of my favorites in Gracia. Disappointment upon returning, not because the food is bad, it has good quality although a lot of frying. It has specialized in tourists and they have raised prices:  40, three tapas and two glasses of white wine, I find it abusive."
La Pepita,Top!!!!!
La Pepita,"I loved the place, I will return!"
La Pepita,"Great service, great team The food is way over rated. I dont think fried food represents Spanish cuisine. And we ordered 10 items, somehow 8 of them are fried. Everything was extremely salty and oily. The place is not kid friendly."
La Pepita,The place has nice atmosphere where you can try really tasty tapas and drink amazing sangria.
La Pepita,Good food and atmosphere
La Pepita,"Best tapas we had during our trip to Barcelona with very friendly staff even when it was quite crowded and busy! We went on a whim on our first day in the city and decided to return a few days later because it was much better than the other tapas bars we went to, plus there was so much on the menu we wanted to try. And even with drinks and dessert, the prices were very good."
La Pepita,Honoring Barcelonas reputation for terrible service. With waiters like that you dont need reviews.
La Pepita,"Vegetarian options: Plenty of vegetarian options. Few vegan options (wine, salad, bread) Food"
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"The food is delicious, the service is good, and the service is super fast. Recommended"
La Pepita,"Un lieu assez petit pour la popularite que ca possede. Pensez a reserver votre table si vous ne voulez pas avoir les serveurs qui vous pressent. Nous sommes venus sans reservation de notre cote et nous etions limites a 21h30, puisquils avaient une reservation derriere. Pas de probleme pour nous donc nous avons pu commander nos meilleurs plats et le serveur, tres sympathique nous a dailleurs conseiller de commander 4 par 4 (soit 2 plats par 2 plats chacun) parce que les portions peuvent etre plus grosse que ce que lon pourrait penser. Tout est detaille quant a viande ou pas viande, les ingredients etc. Les serveurs sont souriants et debarrassent assez vite les assiettes videes. Nous parlons peu espagnol donc la communication anglaise se fait assez vite et bien."
La Pepita,
La Pepita,Excellent service and food!
La Pepita,Very tasty place
La Pepita,
La Pepita,Amazing!
La Pepita,"They are constantly rushing you, taking away your plates and glasses to clear your table as soon as possible. Its not cheap to be kicked out so blatantly. The portions are very fair too. I wouldnt repeat."
La Pepita,"This was my second visit. This time for lunch, and it was as excellent as the first time. The tapas here are creative and delicious. Service is all business, but friendly. Be sure to make a reservation to get a good table. Every item is carefully prepared and fresh. There are many gluten free and dairy free options. My friends with dietary restrictions were happy with how many selections were available for them."
La Pepita,
La Pepita,"Un super restaurant. Meme si nous etions en retard, ils nous ont quand meme garde la place. La nourriture etait delicieuse et le service etait tres sympathique.Super tapas!"

Restaurant BelleBuon,I was speechless! I can only say one word that describes the work of these people inside - dedication and professionalism! Definitely visit if you get a chance!
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Hello, guests of beautiful Barcelona! I am a hobby cook and I have raised the bar very high for delicious food. I am often disappointed that no one can impress me with good cuisine. But this time a top 10 hit! The small, cozy family Italian restaurant made me feel an unimaginable orgasm of the senses. Real home-cooked food, with the typical, traditional and unique taste of my favorite Italian cuisine. All this, accompanied by brilliant service, kindness and a warm welcome! Trust the waiter and ask what his favorite food is . Believe me, it will become your favorite too! Well done to the entire Italian team! Stay healthy, welcome your guests for a long time!"
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"After many years living in Barcelona, without a doubt, my favorite Italian. Thank you Daniel for your always impeccable attention"
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Lugar super recomendado, nos encanta ir. La mejor carbonara que he probado en mi vida, todos los platos caseros exquisitos. El servicio tambien es rapido y amable. No es un lugar especialmente turistico, aunque es pequeno y hay que reservar mejor. Lo encontramos por casualidad y se ha convertido en nuestro italiano favorito de barcelona. !"
Restaurant BelleBuon,"I have never been served, looked after and fed so well in my life! Muchas Gracias!!!"
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,Everything is very good! Best pizza ever
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"The food is fantastic although Im not saying anything new. The impressive tagliatelli with porcini and truffle, gnocchi, pizza, lasagna... All delicious! The service is attentive and very friendly. No exaggerations. The only thing that could be improved is the sound because it is small and bursting! Of course you have to try it and book! We will return for sure!"
Restaurant BelleBuon,The best treatment and the best lasagna for many miles around.
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Couldnt fault this place! Super friendly service, huge portions, great value, delicious food. Loved it."

Restaurant BelleBuon,"The best Italian in the city, and very reasonably priced. Call ahead though, very popular so often booked."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"We went to this welcoming restaurant to eat Italian food. As a Neapolitan critic, I must say that everything was delicious!! Excellent care and hospitality and delicious pasta!"
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Yesterday we ate in this restaurant that I had been talking about a lot, wonderful experience, the lasagna was very good, and the desserts too, the waiters were very attentive, we will return soon."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Unique flavor experience, quality in sauces full of perfume and seasonings in the right measure. I recommend."
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,Excellent I loved it amazing flavor
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Good atmosphere and tasty food but service could very much be improved. One of the waiters was quite intimidating and rushing when it was not necessary, not allowing us to have a good experience. Have 2 shifts to provide bad service, better do just one and make your customers enjoy 100%"
Restaurant BelleBuon,The only thing better than stellar service is fantastic food!
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"I dont use this stuff often because its annoying. Korean people have to go here. Especially for those who like truffles!!!!!! It s the pasta of life The raw noodles dont even smell like flour. Its hard to forget. As soon as I took a bite, I was amazed. I like lasagna, but truffle pasta is even better. The staff is friendly and it seems difficult to find food like this even in Italy. You have to go to Mu conditions."
Restaurant BelleBuon,Very nice staff! And the food is phenomenal :)
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"A charming place that transports you to a picturesque Italian town where the food is great.

Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"We went for dinner and to share we ordered the sausage lasagna which was delicious. For seconds we ordered pappone ravioli which were spectacular, very good flavors and seemed homemade in addition to the famous truffled tagliatelle, being the star dish we expected more truffle flavor and more quantity. The desserts were delicious and the service was incredible, very attentive and served very quickly."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"They dont have the menu in Catalan, but there is no shortage of English. The pasta is good but the dish is poor. So many workers for so few tables make it feel like an elitist restaurant."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Spectacular food, varied menu, super friendly and attentive waiters, highlighting the speed with which they bring you the food. In short, service 10, food 10. We will definitely return!"

Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"The best Italian in Barcelona. A small but cozy place. The fresh pasta is made to order, generous portions and everything couldnt be more delicious. Italian owners. If you are a lover of fresh pasta, lasagna, ggnocchi, this is your restaurant. It is usually full so I recommend booking two or three days in advance. Bellebuone is a safe bet."
Restaurant BelleBuon,My favorite Italian restaurant. The pastas are very top and the service is so good that they make you feel at home

Restaurant BelleBuon,"One of the best Italians in Barcelona. However, I had a better memory of the pasta that was prepared here."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Absolutely exquisite. A little corner of Italy in Barcelona, I live in Madrid and every time I go to Barcelona I make a reservation to eat here. I have come quite a few times and it never disappoints. They convey the passion and dedication they put into each dish. I dont even have photos because when I see the food I get a real craving, 100% recommended."
Restaurant BelleBuon,One of the best restaurants of traditional Italian food in Barcelona. Spectacular mushroom Lasagne and Pugliese. Impeccable Service and Danilos attention has been fantastic. Italian luxury in the heart of Barcelona
Restaurant BelleBuon,"I have been to this restaurant several times to eat and I always leave delighted. If you are looking for a place to eat lasagna, this is your restaurant. They also have a fresh truffle pasta that is amazing. This time we ordered a starter with burrata and two lasagnas, one with raggu and the other with mushrooms and truffle. We were unlucky and the waiter wrote down the order wrong and they brought us two meat lasagnas. Despite this, they were both very good. We will be back."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Wow ! Fantastic Italian food and wonderful service . Recommend making reservations,full every evening Food : 5/5"
Restaurant BelleBuon,

The service is very attentive and efficient. Price a little high, without being exaggerated. We will return without a doubt. Highly recommended."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"We had dinner tonight and everything was spectacular, good service and very good food, thanks to Danilo and congratulations for the Great Team you have"
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Although they asked for a reservation, they did us a favor by going with two people by placing us at a table of four. The food is probably the best Italian food I have ever had in my life, with spectacular presentation, and such friendly service that it made you want to just stay a little longer."
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,The best of Barcelona
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Very good restaurant. The food excellent. The Italian wine... hmm..... wonderful.. The dessert is delicious. But the best was the homemade Limoncello... We have and we will return. Thank you for your friendliness, professionalism and dedication to customers. See you soon"
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Unique experience. Super attentive and personalized service. Divine food with fresh, seasonal ingredients. Suggestions from the boss are something to follow. And an excellent homemade Limoncello."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"A marvel, there is nothing more to add. The truffle pasta dish is literally the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Highly recommended to everyone who visits Barcelona. Vegetarian options: They have several vegetarian options"
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,The best
Restaurant BelleBuon,"We were looking forward to returning and it did not disappoint us. The variety of pasta is spectacular, each better."
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,"We went because it was recommended to us and I dont regret it, it is the best Italian restaurant I have ever tried, the homemade pasta is incredible whatever it is, the staff is very attentive and professional, it doesnt have many tables and that makes it more welcoming, summarizing a 10 I plan to return yes or yes."
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Spectacularly delicious and super generous portions, everything was delicious, the attentive waiter and super good recommendations, you really cant fail."
Restaurant BelleBuon,Spectacular! I had very high expectations because the last time I ate Italian had been in Italy  this place literally takes you away for a little while
Restaurant BelleBuon,
Restaurant BelleBuon,Excellent homemade pasta although the price is a bit high
Restaurant BelleBuon,"Pedimos el plato estrella de Tagliatelle con parmesano, funghi y trufa. Estaban deliciosos y te quedas con ganas de probar todos los platos. Los postres (tiramisu y tartaleta de pistacho) tambien estaban muy buenos. Los camareros fueron muy simpaticos y nos recomendaron en todo momento. El mejor italiano al que he ido en Barcelona. Para repetir."
Honest Greens Tuset,"jai adore  les falafels et le concept (un poil utopique et cliche cependant). Au pdj, trop complique"
Honest Greens Tuset,"I love Honest greens Barcelona!! Its our place!! Dishes, Service, attention, everything always impeccable."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,We went with friends to have a coffee and eat something sweet. But they gave us a portion of Banana bread that we couldnt eat because it was so dry and old. We asked the barista if there was a possibility of heating it but she directly showed me that it was made on the 18th (which took several days). I think they could have been kinder and offered us another alternative but they just turned around and continued their talk.
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"My summary: EXCELLENT FOOD, spectacular place and great vibe. Ive tried almost everything and its delicious. It is something to always come back to. If I have to say that I have an obsession with something, it is with the chocolate cookie that I always order for dessert with an ice latte. Favorite forever. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

Honest Greens Tuset,"Whether for breakfast, lunch or enjoying a quiet afternoon, this restaurant never disappoints. In my opinion, it serves one of the best breakfasts I have ever had, and in terms of food, they are not far behind. I have enjoyed several breakfasts here and they have all been excellent. The same goes for meals; I have tried several dishes and they always maintain the same quality, fresh ingredients, generous portions and delicious flavor. It is no surprise that this restaurant chain is always packed with diners, whether in Barcelona or anywhere else. The desserts are also exceptional, I have tried several and they have all been outstanding. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, Honest Greens simply does not disappoint and is a very healthy place to eat! Congratulations to the whole team! Their dedication and excellence at work are evident, especially considering the volume of activity they handle. Surely it is not an easy task to run this place with such mastery."
Honest Greens Tuset,"Excellent choice Vegetarian options: I have made chicken that was out of the movies and salad, a lot of salad."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"The food is good but charging 5 euros for two filtered tap waters... It didnt seem right to us. It seems that you can serve yourself without limit, but that was not explained to us at the bar...Better to opt for the juice bar for the same price."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"I had wanted to come to this restaurant for a long time and I loved it. The service using the app has been super fast, the service very friendly and the food super delicious. I ordered the supergreen avocado and it is the best salad I have had so far. I also ordered the cookie with chocolate chips and a specialty coffee that was delicious I will return without a doubt"
Honest Greens Tuset,Sooo delicious  and even cheap. I love it! Preferably every day!

Honest Greens Tuset,"I wanted to like this so bad. The menu sounds delicious & this is right up my alley for food I like. I must say though, both me and the person I was with thought that the flavoring just missed the mark. The food tasted kinda bland & I personally found the spices/sauces to be off. Great healthy options, great vibes, but left me feeling  meh."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"The food is excellent, what bothers me most is the ambient music, which is very loud and is not pleasant to eat."
Honest Greens Tuset,"Super tasty, great service."
Honest Greens Tuset,I had the latin bowl with extra falafel very tasty
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"The food was very tasty, there was a DJ and the atmosphere was overall very nice. Big portions for the price, I had a Wild Mediterranean with a Herb Tofu and last left satisfied :)"
Honest Greens Tuset,"Spectacular in all its forms! The food, the attention, the atmosphere...an unbeatable experience! My best healthy spot in BCN!"
Honest Greens Tuset,The best falafel and the best coffee with oat milk
Honest Greens Tuset,Great healthy food with an amazing variety of choice
Honest Greens Tuset,Healthy and delicious food at a fair price in a place with a relaxed atmosphere. The perfect option to replace fast food.
Honest Greens Tuset,i wish they have some more basic options for sides but the honest salmon is delicious and their matcha is very tasty  and the tables are generally clean but not always  they need to pay more attention to the cleanliness of the tables and be more attentive to clear them up in time
Honest Greens Tuset,

Honest Greens Tuset,"I placed an order using the app and wanted to take it with me, which I wrote about in the chat. As a result, I came and waited for my order for an hour in the cafe, but they didnt collect everything. just nonsense"
Honest Greens Tuset,"Rich, rich, rich. Very good dishes and very tasty"
Honest Greens Tuset,The food as always excellent!!! The space is a little noisy but nice and pleasant. Thank you so much!
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,

Honest Greens Tuset,"Every time I eat honest greens I feel like my body thanks me. Its delicious, healthy and has a very good price!"
Honest Greens Tuset,The DJ was really good! She had our group dancing in public! The food is really fresh & the staff are very helpful! I will come back again in the future.

Honest Greens Tuset,"The ordering box is hidden behind a column at the end without any indication. Its even funny to watch how people get lost when they enter the place until they find it. You place an order to take away, they tell you to wait at what they call pick up point which is also not clearly marked. And when your order arrives and you are the only person sitting waiting for orders, the employee leaves it on a table for you without even bothering to address you to ask if that order is for you. In short, delicious food, disastrous experience."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"The food is good and at a super good price the only thing I didnt like was the system they have that asks you to order the food before securing a table, of course when we had our food we had to accommodate ourselves as best we could on a super small table, I think They dont measure correctly how many people they have in line to order and how many tables they have, thats a little stressful but in the end it seemed like a good option."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"Awesome place, highly recommended! Try their banana bread mmmm"
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"Healthy, creative and delicious meal options, generous portions and lots of options to suit your level of appetite. Always presented well with care and attention. Prices I think are excellent value for money. Staff friendly, very attentive and hard working.  I like the layout of this store (in comparison with, say, Placa Catalunya), it feels busy but relaxed and easy to understand where to queue and order your food. The app and fast-scan queue option is a great time-saver."
Honest Greens Tuset,I love this food
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,I had chicken with herbs and mustard accompanied by rice. Very good indeed. Looking forward to coming back and trying new dishes.
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,Healthy and good food!
Honest Greens Tuset,"A very nice place  with a good atmosphere, well decorated with plants, tasty food  balanced at a reasonable price, I will come back to try more dishes 2022 I still go regularly, the menu changes seasonally, to satisfy yourself it is always better to ask for extra accompaniment with each dish 2024"
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"Honest greens has long been one of my favorite places to eat. Great variety of natural products, nearby, and preparation of their dishes, to respect and taste real food. As always, very delicious. As a point of note, as it is a restaurant without prior reservation, an attempt should be made to ensure that all customers who consume and pay in advance can sit down. It is not the restaurants fault that there are disrespectful people who go to one place, sit at the table to reserve and someone else goes to order. While other people who stand in line, wait and go to look for a place, cant find it. And meanwhile, you see many tables that have not even come to order... On the other hand, the fact that there is only one womens bathroom (and another for changing babies/handicapped people) with the large influx at rush hour, is scarce. For everything else, perfect, as always. Vegetarian options: Of course they have endless options. Dietary restrictions: Multiple options can also advise you if you have questions about allergens. Parking: Paid street parking Kid-friendliness: They are accepted and there are many families"
Honest Greens Tuset,"Yesterday, I ask and say: Hello, we have never been here, can you tell us how it works? And they answer me in English. Just like that. The girl at the till, I ask her for an ice cut and she didnt understand me. I repeated up to 3 times an ice cut. Leaving aside that a slice is worth 225 and the dessert was hard as.. There must be people for everything, businesses for everything, and tastes for everything. But not like that, not in Barcelona please."
Honest Greens Tuset,The staff could be improved
Honest Greens Tuset,"Food with many healthy and tasty options. The presentations of the dishes are very careful and colorful. The staff is very friendly and the service is fast. The place is nice and well-kept. The only drawback in my opinion is the noise of the place, the volume of the music is high and has a strict sound; breaks the harmony of the premises. Vegetarian options: Has many vegetarian options"
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,Perfect
Honest Greens Tuset,"Healthy and very good food, the service is quite fast and correct. Good place to eat well and quickly. Good coffee!"
Honest Greens Tuset,"Amazing food, tried almost the entore menu and you cant go wrong - everything is delicious"
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"Ideal place to eat cheap and well. You choose your food quickly (from your cell phone or from the queue itself) and you have it ready to eat. Its like fast food but healthy. The dishes are very varied. If you buy a glass you have unlimited drinks (some juices and teas). The atmosphere was great but it was very crowded, it looked more like a bar."
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"I really like the concept of Honest Greens, I have eaten in Lisbon, Madrid and Barcelona but the Honest Greens in Tuset is by far the worst in service of all the ones I have visited. And in Barcelona I have been to all four restaurants. They make the wrong dishes, they take a while to bring your food and they dont clean the tables. A stain on a good brand"
Honest Greens Tuset,"Super delicious, super good atmosphere. Recommended!"
Honest Greens Tuset,"today the lady from staff was very rude. we finished or meal and decided to have a desert. suddenly the staff lady came to us bluffing that we are not allowed to sit before we ordered. we answered that we already ate and wait for dessert. after she told us to be rude and she is only doing her job. she did not ask us if we ordered, she did not ask if we are waiting, she jump to conclusions and assumed something. very upsetting experience. 27.02.2024 today we came at a time it should be easy to get a table (18 to 19) and all bench table was blocked by Damm notebook user ( 18 seats  blocked by 7 people with Notebooks) half of them had a empty coffee cup."
Honest Greens Tuset,EXCESSIVELY LOUD MUSIC IMPOSSIBLE TO EAT RELAXED
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"The place and food are very good. They also have an App in Catalan that offers advantages for recurring users Vegetarian options: Various vegetarian potions with tofu, salads, etc."
Honest Greens Tuset,"I just want to thank you, you are my favorite restaurant. And recently I had the worst day of my life and I just wanted to order honest greens for dinner and be happy... my order had complications in arriving, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much they helped me. I want to highlight someone who is an angel who works in her company, her name is Connie    . She helped me and solved the problem until my order arrived and on top of that with a little gift! I am a loyal and frequent customer and for me that means taking care of us. She was so kind and made my day better    . Thanks Connie! Thanks honest greens  . I love them"
Honest Greens Tuset,Oh my god! What a place! The best food and atmosphere Fresh ingredients and original flavor!! Cool!! Vegetarian options: A lot!!
Honest Greens Tuset,Good atmosphere. We went Sunday morning and we really liked both the Service and the place. You must order at the cashier and you serve the table. There are sofa areas.
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,
Honest Greens Tuset,"A place where food comes out quickly and you can enjoy fresh salads! There are several Honest Green branches in Barcelona, and among them, Tuset has almost no Koreans or Chinese, but mostly local people, such as office workers and local residents. I like Ernest Green so much that I download the app, order in advance online, show the QR for fast track, and receive a vibrating bell. It gets really crowded during lunch time, so I recommend getting the app and ordering in advance. The English menu is good, so ordering isnt difficult. You have to order cafe or dessert items and pick them up directly from the bar, and the staff personally serves the food after watching the vibrating bell. The brunch menu (yogurt, burrito, etc. - in the photo) is sold before 12 oclock, so if you want to order a salad bowl or plate, go after 12 oclock. Personally, I go for the green bowl with veal (ternera) or grilled salmon, seasoned with piri piri sauce. So, I recommend adding protein, such as spicy chicken, because it tastes even better! They give you a lot of vegetables and the sauce is fresh and delicious without being too spicy!"
Honest Greens Tuset,"I love this place. The quality of food, taste, choice, service - everything is incredible. Food is healthy. They have really good dressings for every meal. Ben s potatoes are my favourite! Defenitly recommend it !!"
Honest Greens Tuset,good experience
Honest Greens Tuset,It is a  fast food  but with good and healthy food. Correct price quality and good quantity of food. I will repeat without hesitation. Perhaps the only drawback is that sometimes the music is very loud and does not allow for a quiet conversation.
Honest Greens Tuset,
Burritos - Sant Pere,Good stuff! Ate here twice.

Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,The best burrito and the best Nachos I have ever eaten!! I love them    greetings from Italy
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,Boss Ali was super nice! Can highly recommend :)
Burritos - Sant Pere,"La nourriture est tres copieuse et y a beaucoup de choix mais je ne pourrais pas dire autant du personnel qui ont bacle mes choix pour mon burrito, equipe tres jeune mais pas dynamique et les toilettes laisse a desirer et ne sont pas competants Wheelchair accessibility: Il n y pas de marche a l entree"
Burritos - Sant Pere,Fantastic burritos!!! worth going!
Burritos - Sant Pere,"I could give 1 star but decided to be a little nicer. I got a veggie bowl and they person working there gave me 1 small spoon of veggies  c mon. They are just trained to cheat people. I m paying  9 not for a soon of veggies. After I empathized that it s a veggie bowl, I should get more veggies. The staff stared being a little rude. I do not recommend this place. If you are in a Barcelona, the best burrito place is   Tierra burrito"
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Was here in 2022, everything went speedy and the burritos were really good, rich of taste and fulfilling"
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,Super good
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Very tasty burritos! Unfortunately, we are not welcome as  tourists . I understand a lot of Spanish and words were said towards us that were very embarrassing. Unfortunately, the good burritos were overshadowed by the poor service."
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Similar to Chipotle back in the U.S. Had their pork burrito, and it was a large portion size, just like a Chipotle burrito. Stand in line, and walk through your ingredients line, to have your burrito, taco, nachos prepared. If you re looking for an American sized portion this will definitely check that box, to fill you up. Good place, for a quick lunch, to fill you up when you re in a hurry."
Burritos - Sant Pere,"A burrito I will never forget.. fast , cheap and really tasty"
Burritos - Sant Pere,I give 1 star because I dont see that they only have 1 sink and it is shared and it is super dirty
Burritos - Sant Pere,Nothing expensive and rich. Nice and young and friendly staff.
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Interesting dynamic, but they dont explain it to you, they have prices at the bar and when you order, in the end they end up charging you a lot more, for two REGULAR size tacos, and  15 for two tacos, the meat salts well, but it doesnt have enough flavor, on top they put the ingredients they want, they dont expect you to choose the ingredients, I personally feel that their portions are small, I wouldnt go back, and their rating is poorly done because the treatment is not the most pleasant either. The space is poorly distributed and tables are all folded. The legs of the chairs dance."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Shoutout to Chef Ali for the delicacy!
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Very friendly and tasty food, worth the money."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Good food
Burritos - Sant Pere,"How sad that due to inflation, I can no longer afford it. I remember that when they opened the burritos were  5.90, then they went to  6.90, with the quantity-quality they offered it was very worth it. But today I pass by and find them at 8.50. I had to go to the hamburger restaurant across the street."
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Excellent food, excellent customer service and excellent place. Thank you very much for serving us so well. We will return without a doubt."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Very good food and very good service. Ideal for eating something quick.
Burritos - Sant Pere,"It is one of the best place to eat something delicious in barcelona, we tried 3-4 things and everything was too good, especially burritos"
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Prices arent transparent, Burrito was cold. Qite dirty and slow."
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Tasty food,but a bit overpriced"
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,Amazing how the price keeps going up and up and up. 2 years ago a burrito was  5.60. now its  8.90. Disgusting.
Burritos - Sant Pere,"The burrito was delicious, although they put half a spoon of meat, or whatever you put in it. The burrito looks more like a ball, and I received it cold. Very clueless and unprofessional workers. They neither greet you nor talk to you and they just stare at you until you order. 0 training While eating I have seen customers having to clear their tables to be able to sit down. Its good to know how to charge and put all the ingredients together, but not having a professional image kills the quality of the experience. The ingredients themselves were good."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Very good price quality. Every time I go to BCN we go.
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Well.. not bad, for a Quick meal, but ive eaten better. Ingredients over done, so hardly any structure left"
Burritos - Sant Pere,"You can also eat burritos and tacos. If you are confident in your Spanish, choose from a variety of foods. If youre not confident, you can easily order a burrito with predetermined fillings. This time I ordered the burrito Barcelona. It had a variety of ingredients, and the sauce was a little spicy, but not extremely spicy. There are many tables inside the restaurant, so I think its a good place to have a casual meal."
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Fabulous burritos! I havent had a burrito made this well in a long time. Tasty meat and lots of choice of ingredients, friendly staff. Half mandatory"
Burritos - Sant Pere,"We ate the veggie burritos and the truth is, they were very tasteless, we were not very satisfied"
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,This is it. This is the spot. We lucked out with our Air BnB being so close to this restaurant. Delicious burritos and quesadillas. Highly recommend.

Burritos - Sant Pere,"1st: the food is the best in mexican food, you will surely enjoy each bite 2nd: staff spoke good english and is very attentive 3rd: the atmosphere is very nice"
Burritos - Sant Pere,"The serving concept and the staffs were nice. To be honest, our expectations were more for Burrito. However, it could be tried. (It was the first time we tried Burrito.)"

Burritos - Sant Pere,"We usually go and order delivery but the last 2 times it has been FATAL, I ordered carnitas and it had no flavor and it wasnt even crumbled. Unfortunately they have lowered the quality and I dont think I will order more..."
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Great place if you want to have something fast but at the same time very tasty! I appreciate they have vegetarian options as well. All the ingredients they used were fresh and of good quality. The tortilla was good and held everything together perfectly. The service was very fast. There are a few places to sit inside or outside. Everything just perfect! Vegetarian options: They have vegetarian options, you can also select which ingredients you want or not."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Wow! The best empanadas and tequenos I have tried in Barcelona. Highly recommended and the service has been excellent. Wow! Best Venezuelan empanadas I had in Barcelona! Amazing service and prices are reasonable. Highly recommended

Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,"The ingredients didn t taste very fresh and didn t have much flavor in general. Had a bland burrito with old, dry rice for  8.50. There aren t many places to sit inside so keep in mind it might be hard to find a table during lunch. The service was friendly and helpful."
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,"The customer service is fast and excellent, I have seen that they serve in multiple languages and very fluently, the food is delicious and the burritos are very filling, the money is well spent. And even though I like the atmosphere in the restaurant, the bathrooms are very dirty and poorly maintained."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Overpriced for the average place. Uncomfortable sittings inside.
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Chef Ali made us feel welcome and he makes the best food! We would definitely come back, the food was fresh and delicious! So many choices to customize your bowl!"
Burritos - Sant Pere,"The truth is that I have come several times, but I was dissatisfied because the girl who served me gave me a very small portion compared to the previous ones, my husband bought another one just like it and the boy doubled the portion they gave me, So it means that the portion goes according to the person who serves you."
Burritos - Sant Pere,"It is the third time I have come with my wife, but this time it was terrible, the girl who served us had a very bad face, she gave minimal portions, I would not have that girl serve me again."
Burritos - Sant Pere,Lovely !!
Burritos - Sant Pere,"Great food, very nice and helpful staff, everything was served fresh and quickly. A great place on the map of Barcelona"
Burritos - Sant Pere,
Burritos - Sant Pere,I recommend the burrito as it has a lot of portions.
Burritos - Sant Pere,"I love it, I still go regularly even though they have raised the price several times in recent years, going from 6.50 to 8.50 burrito in 2 years, I still think it is worth it and that it is a very good place to go to eat, the ingredients They are fresh and super good and the workers are always very cool and treat you great, almost every week I come to eat here ( ^ ^)"

Arcano Restaurant,Delicieux !
Arcano Restaurant,They are super strong bravo
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,Excellent service and food! I would repeat without a doubt
Arcano Restaurant,Some of the best salmon I ve had. Make reservations.
Arcano Restaurant,"Both the Argentina s steak and the tuna tatami were top notch. Super happy to have found a resteraunt in the neighbourhood that has such delicious food! The ambiance is cozy, enigmatic and the service friendly. Recommended!"
Arcano Restaurant,We had a very enjoyable evening with delicious food.  The portions were large! I would have enjoyed the tasting menu but was advised that it would have been a challenge! The staff are a great team and their pride and commitment to their work shines through. Highly recommend! Vegetarian options: The vegetable starter with Romesco sauce was delicious.  I would have enjoyed more of the sauce!
Arcano Restaurant,"We did a tasting menu and everything was very good! The waiters are also very good. Maybe a little slow between dishes, it is to go without rushing. Good experience"
Arcano Restaurant,"Everything about our dinner there was excellent! Specifically want to applaud our waiter Carlos - the attention and service really stood out. We had the tasting menu and every course was truly delicious, and the proposed wine pairing - delightful!"
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,Tres tres bonne
Arcano Restaurant,"Fantastic place, really nice experience"
Arcano Restaurant,Cozy walled place with a very good atmosphere. They treated us wonderfully and the food was delicious. Extensive wine list for all budgets. Recommendable!!
Arcano Restaurant,"It was a suitable restaurant to spend our last evening in Barcelona. The food, wine and atmosphere were all good. And he was kind. Also, being able to have dinner starting at 6:30 was an advantage for tourists."
Arcano Restaurant,"Superb restaurant.  Went with my family while visiting Barcelona.  Everything was good.  On the higher end budget wise (ended up being $50 USD per person for food, drinks, and dessert) but not outrageous.  Definitely worth it."
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,Great service. The location was very cozy and intimate. And the food couldn t have been better. And kudos to Faris as our server. He was super nice and was tentative.
Arcano Restaurant,"everything perfect, very friendly staff delicious food I recommend it"
Arcano Restaurant,"Feris was an incredible waiter, he made us have a very pleasant time"
Arcano Restaurant,"Food, service and atmosphere is 5 stars."
Arcano Restaurant,"We went for dinner at the end of February over our weekend getaway, and the restaurant exceeded my expectations! I am rather picky about the food, and there was no restaurant that made me go wow, but Arcano surely did! We ordered the 3rd tasting menu for the table and the food was 11/10! Truly no complaints. Our waiter Marcel, was also so friendly and professional, it made the whole experience so great. The interior design is amazing, and definitely giving off late 17th century vibes! There was even a small power outrage, but they handled it so professionally and humorously, that it actually benefited the experience. I am already telling everyone I know about them lol. We will definitely return, if not for Barcelona, for Arcano for sure! Thank you, Arcano team!"
Arcano Restaurant,"Que decir?! Todo bien muchas gracias a usted Tres belle endroit, tres belle ambiance et par dessus tout la cuisine etait parfaite, les viandes et le vin etaient delicieux. Je recommande"
Arcano Restaurant,Delicious food. I arrived without a reservation and by pure luck there was a spot available. I ordered the sirloin with cheese sauce and it was crazy.
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,"In general I have to say that it was a good experience. The place has a good design, the atmosphere seemed very touristy and the tables were quite close together but the flavor of each dish made up for it. The two waiters were friendly and very correct. We took the  38 tasting menu, I positively highlighted the spectacular sausage with mushrooms and the cuttlefish croquettes were very good, the cod to my taste was fine, nothing more, and the cheese cake is not what I expected, the acidity of the red fruits is They carried all the flavor of the cheese, maybe its the intention, I dont know. We had a nice evening and I recommend it."
Arcano Restaurant,"Restaurant with a cozy atmosphere, a little dark, with a quality product and with simple but very successful preparation. The meats stand out, which I think should be served without mixing sauces, grilled and which can be tasted on the menu or on the menu. There are three tasting menus,  38.48.58, without drink, with four starters to share and a second to choose from, dessert included. Friendly, quick and professional service. A good place Price between  40-60."

Arcano Restaurant,"What an exceptional experience! The service was fantastic - we missed our reservation by about 20 minutes, but they were able to accommodate us. We started with the truffle egg, pan con tomate, and fresh tomatoes and olives. It was a very fresh start to the meal. The truffle egg was our favorite the truffle flavor was subtle but noticeable, and it was even better with a bit of fresh bread. We ordered the Argentinian skirt steak, the sirloin, and the tuna. Alongside, we got two sides of vegetables and mashed potatoes. The steaks were perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned. We ordered truffle sauce on the side and it complemented the steak, vegetables, and potatoes. The tuna was beautifully prepared, and the sesame sear added texture and flavor. Everything was so simple but so well prepared and extremely satisfying. I wish we lived locally so we could visit more often!"
Arcano Restaurant,"Very nice place in the heart of one of the tourist areas of Barcelona. Delicious food, interesting architecture, good service. Portions a little small for the price, but good flavor."
Arcano Restaurant,"A place to enjoy. The atmosphere was a plus. Kind waiters, good service and the food was delicious"
Arcano Restaurant,"This place is a must go while in Barcelona! The food is deltas so many vegan options! As a vegan I was skeptical looking at the menu at first glance, but our waiter, Leonardo, gave several recommendations that were vegan friendly! I highly highly highly recommend this place and ask for Leonardo! He was an amazing waiter. He gave fantastic recommendations, was friendly, and when we wanted more wine or added items to our order he quickly submitted the tickets to the kitchen! The food was delicious and the wine list was amazing and affordable! I had the artichoke ravioli with a coconut curry sauce and a veggie plate! My husband had steak! All so yummy!"
Arcano Restaurant,"All very good. The price is a bit expensive, but it is already known that the area where the restaurant is located has this handicap."
Arcano Restaurant,"we had a great time, food was good, hospitality was excellent, our waiter was knowledgeable"
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,"I dont often leave reviews, but Im posting this to share great restaurants with everyone. Its really delicious and the service is great. Even though I didnt make a reservation, I waited and went in. I always ordered octopus whenever I came to Spain, and I can say that it was by far the best. Be sure to order it John is kind and nice Te quiero"
Arcano Restaurant,John was fabulous. He was very nice and took care of us nicely!! It was the best night in barcelona! Hola! Food
Arcano Restaurant,Lovely we appreciate the service from fares he is amazing
Arcano Restaurant,"In a hidden street in Barcelona, we find a Restaurant (Arcano) with high quality cuisine, exquisite service and well-kept facilities. Exquisite croquettes, delicious bravas. The second dish in the same line. Salmon and entrecote with garnish...Brutal. accompanied by a young broth from Penedes. Price quality, one hundred percent in proportion. But best of all my company (Rous). We were very happy with everything. Thank you."
Arcano Restaurant,The place is very beautiful and romantic. Excellent food and perfect service. We will repeat!
Arcano Restaurant,"A most exquisite dinner, everything perfect and great service. Without a doubt we will repeat, Thanks to the Arcano team for everything!!"
Arcano Restaurant,"Local in the heart of Born with a cool interior, exposed vault, careful lighting, professional service and good wines. They work very well with the meats but the starters caught my attention (dont miss the squid croquettes) and the desserts (they were exquisite). Thank you Jimena for serving us so well. We will be back!!"
Arcano Restaurant,"The food is good, the service when we arrived too, but we spent more than 20 minutes for them to take our order and they took our order for two tables that arrived after us... I think it was because of the waiter we had, another colleague who brought us the wine was charming. We asked the waiter if the dessert had citrus fruits and he confirmed that it didnt. The surprise was when they brought them to us and yes it did. I think that on a menu you have to know what the dishes have and if you dont know you cant confirm it since He wondered about allergies. I repeat, I think we were unlucky with who served us, we were the youngest in the room and the truth is that the treatment was not the same as what the foreigners received...I think it is not normal and it seemed like a lack of respect. But I repeat, the food is good and the place is beautiful."
Arcano Restaurant,The atmosphere is good but wrong food served to me. I was order national beef skirt steak but served me Argentinean August sirloin steak which cost me more. I not blame to waiter maybe wrong English communication. but it shall proposed to exchange for me when I informed the waiter ( sending the food to me). The space is limited as crowded always. Suggest to go somewhere with nice steak in nearby if you will be arranged to the bar seat. The training no enough for handling customer.
Arcano Restaurant,

Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,"Everything about this restaurant impressed me: the food, atmosphere, wine, and staff. I started with a delicious croqueta, followed by a main course of both rack of lamb and entrecote steak, both of which were excellent. For dessert, I enjoyed a Miel Mato Arcano (assuming its a specific dish name). Located in the heart of Barcelona, the restaurants location also makes it a great place to visit for a pleasant stroll before or after your meal."
Arcano Restaurant,c etait incroyable ! un de nos meilleurs repas a Barcelone    avec des serveurs attentionnes dans un cadre cosy. on se garde l adresse sous le coude pour notre prochaine visite
Arcano Restaurant,"We ordered these 4 dishes and they were delicious! I would go back a thousand times over, it must be emphasized that the steak tartar was delicious!"
Arcano Restaurant,Lovely night celebrating birthday. The food was perfect. The service was friendly and very professional. The atmosphere of the place was warm and welcoming. Thank you
Arcano Restaurant,"My first week in Barcelona, and its the second time trying seafood. It was amazing! You should definitely try the grilled octopus and grilled salmon. As for desserts, I tried cheesecake. Its not your regular cheesecake, but still, it was really delicious. The staff was super nice, and the service was excellent. The atmosphere in the restaurant is a bit noisy, but thats typical of most restaurants Ive been to in Barcelona. For me, it was one of the best experiences in Barcelona."
Arcano Restaurant,All dishes were delicious . I have never eaten such delicious Grilled octopus.
Arcano Restaurant,"What a great spot.  The ambience is so cool and the food is great.  The only thing that was a little weird for me was the peanut sauce on the Iberian Pork, but it was still good.  We ordered a lot of food and was all a hit."
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,"Very good service from everyone, especially the good friend Javi, also good quality of food, the Iberian pork is excellent"
Arcano Restaurant,Argentinian angus was very tasty
Arcano Restaurant,"Romantic dinner with my wife. Arcano has a lovely atmosphere with a very friendly, young and skilled staff. Lorenzo served us professionally recommending us the right  wine to match with the dishes we ordered. He also described very clearly the food he served us time to time. We went for one of the tasting menu: excellent the egg with mushroom, the iberian pork and truffle and the dessert based on ricotta cheese. The price? not expensive at all and absolutely adequate to the value of the dinner Highly recommended"
Arcano Restaurant,"Je recommande, tres bon"
Arcano Restaurant,"Our first time at Arcano was outstanding! It completely exceeded my expectations. Our server Lenonardo was so attentive to all of our needs. He was professional, friendly and created such a positive experience. The food was delicious. We got three courses and each item was elegantly placed and visually special. The warm ambience was very cozy! I do not have anything bad to say. I cant wait to come back again!"
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,"Wonderful experience. Food was delicious and well timed. Atmosphere was interesting and beautiful. Service was top notch. Fares, our waiter, was personable and knowledgeable."
Arcano Restaurant,"I made a reservation and visited as my last dinner before leaving the country! I ate it as a course meal and it was so delicious that I felt like my stomach was going to burst. The price is not low, but it would be nice to feel good in a good atmosphere once in a while! And the staff are so friendly"
Arcano Restaurant,"Lieu surprenant,  chaleureux. Accueil exclusivement masculin donc tres agreable...cuisine originale excellente .je recommande vraiment"
Arcano Restaurant,"We went to eat last Saturday and we liked everything, Leonardo attended us with great professionalism, recommending the best options and was very friendly, delighted and eager to return again"
Arcano Restaurant,"Absolutely amazing experience. Wait staff was so kind (our waiter Marcelo was the best!) and fit us in even after a mistaken reservation, and each food item was perfection. Perfect way to celebrate a birthday with an affordable yet luxury meal in Barcelona! Highly recommend the tuna and the  national  cut of steak."
Arcano Restaurant,Cool restaurant in a super neat building. Enjoyed my tomato dish here.
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,Excellent gastronomic restauranr havimg ver friendly staff serving you
Arcano Restaurant,An absolutely delightful place with exquisite food.
Arcano Restaurant,"We had dinner at this restaurant, which turned out to be one of the best places I have ever eaten. For lovers of fat, they have Angus fillets, which would bring a dead man back to life. A real specialty, the potatoes served with flowers which I recommend trying. If we return to Barcelona we will definitely stay here again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,
Arcano Restaurant,"What a beautiful and amazing restaurant! Had a wonderful meal here with great service! Tip: reservations are wise, because it is a popular address."
Arcano Restaurant,"We ordered one of the tasting menus and everything, absolutely everything, was exquisite. The seconds, both meat and fish, are just right. And the spectacular desserts. Everything was very well presented. The restaurant is tastefully decorated in a rustic atmosphere. Jimena attended us, very professional, friendly and attentive at all times. We will repeat for sure"
Arcano Restaurant,"The attention, the place and above all the food was delicious... the only mistake is that we like the meat rare but we didnt eat it anyway... I would definitely return once again... Parking: There is a paid parking nearby"
Arcano Restaurant,"This restaurant was simply perfect. The entire staff was attentive, accommodating, friendly, just great. The food- Wow. Everything we had was exquisite, including the burrata injected with pesto, the farm egg with mushrooms, and the veal ravioli."
Arcano Restaurant,Jimena excellent Dietary restrictions: Steaks are lush Food : 5/5 |
Arcano Restaurant,"This is the place you are looking for, when you are looking for  that  place. Decor is exposed stone and wood, lighting is low and intimate. We didn t reserve a table but they offered us seats at the bar. It turns out these were probably the best seats in the house. The place was full from when we got there to when we left and they were turning people away as well. Staff very friendly and knowledgable. Service absolutely on point. Variety of wine was impressive, although heavily influenced by Spanish and Catalonian regions (ps try anything from the Monsant region). We tried one of the taster menus at about 50Euros each and each meal (of which there were lots) was cooked to perfection. If you are lucky enough to stumble across this place - well done you! Otherwise, take my word for it, it is a great restaurant with great food, now pretend to your other half that you know of a  nice little place to grab some food .  It won t disappoint."

Arcano Restaurant,"Highly recommend this restaurant. Some of the best steak I ve ever had, with amazing truffle sauce and fries! Great friendly waiters who offered good recommendations. I would 100% come back"
Arcano Restaurant,Very good experience. Both Jimenas attention and the spectacular food. The point of the meat is great.

Die Preise sind attraktiv und angemessen.

Restaurant La Boqueria,"Very good food. The paella met all of the conditions that we were instructed to look for: it was not small single portions, it was cooked in a visible area, it took at least 30-45 min to prepare (as nothing the chef used appeared to be frozen). We also tried the fried eggplant chips with honey drizzle which were surprisingly tasty."

Champanillo Barcelona,"The waiters treat you like a dog. Very bad manners. Lousy food. Cheap and poor quality. Its scary that the city of Barcelona is betting on this type of business where only alcohol prevails and the food is garbage... The pitiful service, without education or training."
Champanillo Barcelona,The terrible service The senseless organization and the regrettable treatment.
Champanillo Barcelona,Deplorable service and atmosphere. They should close the place It cannot be understood that a place like this is open in Barcelona

Champanillo Barcelona,Very rich and economical
Champanillo Barcelona,They offer gluten-free hamburgers and they are very good!
Champanillo Barcelona,"Snack bar, with an affordable price and good quality in general. But for people who have to eat gluten-free, no. You have to pay extra for gluten free bread, and even though they have a fryer for the potatoes, they mix all the fries, so there is cross contamination. Would not recommend, plain sandwich and very dry."
Champanillo Barcelona,"Good and well priced fast food restaurant. The fries are delicious, especially the bacon and cheedar ones. The burger bun is good. The burgers are not very generous in size but they are correct for the price. You order at the bar, you pick up your drink and they serve you the food. From hamburgers, salads, nuggets, bikinis, wings, croquettes, normal sandwiches, frankfurters...,"

Champanillo Barcelona,"If youre not celiac, its great. IF YOU ARE CELIAC, DO NOT EAT THERE. They told me that they had options and that they controlled active and passive cross contamination (I am very tired of this topic), however, after looking into the kitchen (you can see it from the restaurant) I saw that they do everything on the same plate. They dont clean it or anything. If they dont offer a safe option for celiacs, simply dont offer it."

They removed the whole dish and brought back one chicken strip, even though they took away 2... Also very loud, crowded, and overall one of the worst place ive eaten at in Barcelona."
Champanillo Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"Im very demanding when it comes to restaurant food and I was absolutely delighted to eat here. Me and my partner had few remarkable tapas. First we were a bit suspicious because the prices were higher than what we experienced so far in Barcelona. But now I can say it is absolutely worth the money and I would rather starve for three days and spend everything I have here, than going to five other restaurants. Service was also very friendly and sweet. We will be back and I will remember this food for a long long time, which doesnt happen to me very often anymore. GRACIAS! By the way I had no chance to take any picture, the food was just gone from my plate too fast :)"
Viana Barcelona,"Luis, super smiling waiter, attentive, precise and very nice... Let him accompany you in choosing the dishes!!"
Viana Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"Lovely people, nice atmosphere and delightful food and wine"
Viana Barcelona,We tried the tasting menu and it was terrific!! The size of the dishes was just right. The staff very accommodating and friendly. I also like to have a casual saying on my lips. We barely waited for our food. Everything was perfectly timed. Thank you for the great food!! :) I will come back on my next trip to Barcelona!
Viana Barcelona,The best food we got in Barcelona. We went for the tasting menu and all the courses tasted beautiful. Highly recommended.
Viana Barcelona,"Excellent food!! We got some wine, the scallops, the beef cheek, the squid ink pasta, and the  French toast  dessert. We were also given a free egg roll appetizer. All of the dishes were delicious! The portions were a little small, so the tasting menu would be a great deal if you re pretty hungry. The service was fantastic. The servers were very nice and kindly let us sit in the  bar  area. We didn t have a reservation on a Monday night, but the place was packed! I definitely recommend making one unless you are fine with sitting at the bar and arrive before 8PM. As an American, I appreciated that they gave us a large bottle of water and did not automatically put bread on the table. The bottled water was incredible too, but maybe that s just because I was just in Rome and Athens prior to this."
Viana Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"Spectacular!! Very good, quality food and very attentive service, I recommend it"

Viana Barcelona,Excellent experience. Nothing to add. Dietary restrictions: They ask about food allergies and high attention to food
Viana Barcelona,"I was looking for a unique restaurant for a family trip and made a reservation/visit. First of all, my partner loved it because it was so delicious...what else can I say? These are menus where the food has been recreated with a bit of fusion. Quality is good. Plating and taste that women enjoy. The number one food in our family is  octopus + potatoes. A middle school girls cocktail is an all-shot lol. Order a cocktail and try it. Its delicious."
Viana Barcelona,The best restaurant in Barcelona hands down. From appetiser to dessert - everything was perfect! Will definitely come back.
Viana Barcelona,Great food and friendly staff
Viana Barcelona,I recommend the blackberry mojito. I drank two glasses. The owner understands a little Korean. He understood the two of us while they were talking and placed our order. He was friendly and the food was very delicious. Please note that there is a bit of a price range.

Viana Barcelona,"Superb food. Generally speaking, all the dishes are tasty, but the tuna, the Jamon Iberico, and the grilled octopus are absolutely delicious. If not opting for the tasting menu, at least one of the three should be part of the meal. For drinks, if not opting for a full bottle of wine, trust the servers recommendations: they suggested wonderful pairings to the food."
Viana Barcelona,I think I should try most of the menu here. very good

Viana Barcelona,"The staff is top: very kind, competent, thoughtful and friendly without being intrusive. Fusion food, refined and delicious, of the highest quality from every point of view. They have proposed solutions for lactose intolerance very carefully. Exceptional house cocktails and sangria. The only thing that could be improved could be the variety of options for vegetarians. 100% worth trying"
Viana Barcelona,Very cosy place with excellent food and polite staff.
Viana Barcelona,"Lovely little restaurant in the Gothic Quarter, a few minutes walking distance from Las Ramblas. Certainly more a 4.5*. I was recommended this restaurant by some friends, but being a Monday in October, I didnt think necessary to book. Little did I know! It was fully booked, no tables available the whole evening, but they made some room for me at the bar. However, the wait was worth it, it certainly didnt disappoint. In fact, the food was better than I had expected! The restaurant is very small, but they have recently opened a bigger one just round the corner. Much needed for what I saw, people queuing up outside non-stop. The food is very good, the service excellent and the prices reasonable. You are served an appetiser on arrival. I had the marinated tuna dices, the linguine and the threesome of chocolate as desert. All high quality ingredients, very well cooked and presented. Highly recommended if you are in the area and I will certainly be back!"
Viana Barcelona,"The best food Ive had it a while!! The blackberry mojito is superb, perfect blend of alcohol and fruit. The Iberian Jamon was perfect with toasted bread and tomato glaze. And my goodness, i will be dreaming about the piece of cod I had over roasted apples. SO GOOD. Wait staff was knowledgeable and welcoming and very accommodating to English speaking guests. My only suggestion is to make a reservation beforehand because the restaurant space is very small and its hard for them to take walk ins! Truly recommend this sensational restaurant"
Viana Barcelona,"Great little place, great food and fantastic service. Highly recommended."
Viana Barcelona,Jamais decu. La cuisine delicieuse et l accueil chaleureux

Viana Barcelona,"The restaurant was super comfortable, the service was wonderful and the food was incredible. There were 5 of us and each of us ordered a different dish and we were delighted. Highly recommended."

Viana Barcelona,Good squid ink croquettes. Food was overall good
Viana Barcelona,"I must say that I will not get tired of visiting Viana, the service is incredible, all the waiters are super attentive and what can I say about the dishes, brutal!! Cheesecake never disappoints, you try to imitate it but its impossible haha"
Viana Barcelona,"From the outside, it looked like a bar, so we were wondering if this was the place, but the staff member who saw it smiled and talked to us, and we took a seat inside the store. We didnt make a reservation so we couldnt get a table, but the seats we got werent bad either. The menu uses a QR code, and there arent that many types of food, and each item has a photo, so it was easy to order. All the food was so delicious. Its so pretty and tastes good, so I feel good. Haha. Be sure to try the dessert. The staff is so friendly that I want to come again. I recommend it"
Viana Barcelona,What a delightful place. We just happened upon this restaurant and am so glad we decided to go in. The servers were so friendly and their English was great. The food was excellent!!

Viana Barcelona,"Deuxieme repas chez Viana ou nous avions dine voici deux ans. Accueil toujours exceptionnel, gentillesse absolue de tout le staff hyper chaleureux et cuisine excellente, Nos meilleurs repas a Barcelone. Reservez, sinon c est pas la peine !"
Viana Barcelona,"Same-day reservations were available, so I made a reservation and there were a lot of Koreans. We ordered poppo, linguine, honeyed beef, and blackberry mojito! The puff pastry and linguine were very delicious, but the beef dish was a little less to my taste than I expected. I thought it was like chunks of steak, but it felt like a bunch of thinly sliced soybean paste mixed together. Even though I can t drink alcohol, the blackberry mojito was very delicious! The server kept coming by to check if it was to our taste and was very friendly."
Viana Barcelona,Its delicious... the black mojito and torija are delicious... the scallops are also delicious.
Viana Barcelona,"Excellent local playing in Placa Reial. We did the  50 menu and were delighted. The ham is very good, as is the burrata. The tuna and the Galician-style octopus seemed delicious. For second courses we had the veal melos and the rice with mushrooms and foie, which were at the same level as the first ones. I didnt expect too much due to the very touristic location of the place, but in that small kitchen they work wonders. And the service is up to par, always attentive and very pleasant. I recommend it 100%"
Viana Barcelona,Were here for the first time & will definitely come back! Service and food top
Viana Barcelona,Doesnt open the door. I visited but ended up in vain.
Viana Barcelona,Fantastic paella and livini!!
Viana Barcelona,"6/5 stars (if there was such a thing) I have to start with the staff because they are just exceptional! They take care of you like you are their most honored guest but that goes for everyone. Great selection of wine and the bar-attendant, Miguel, is top notch, can whip you up anything. But if you are in a mood for cocktail, I d recommend his signature blackberry mojito. It s very unique and really tasty! I had a tasting menus which was so delicious. Comes with an app, 4 tapas (the octopus and the pan con tomate are the perfection), a main and desert. The value to money spent ratio is really high. I would agree with previous reviewers, this will be my regular stop when in town. Dietary restrictions: They ask you as soon as you sit down if you have any dietary restriction and will do their best to accommodate gluten free, vegetarian (maybe more but that s all I heard from guests sitting near by)"
Viana Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"Very positive. Very good food, very original presentation. Dealing with the very familiar waiter. In general ... very good quality and price, more than reasonable."
Viana Barcelona,A good restaurant in the centre. Quality meat and paiella
Viana Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"I went to this restaurant after seeing the ratings, and it was as delicious as the ratings. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious, and I was happy with the quick service and friendly staff. The only drawback is that we were seated in front of the entrance, so every time the door opened, there was a lot of wind coming in and it was a bit crowded in the aisle. The table was a bit small, so there wasnt enough space for food, but the well-trained waiters took our empty plates right away. It was possible because they cleaned it up. The signature drink, Blackberry Mojito, didnt have much alcohol and was so delicious that I almost kept drinking it."
Viana Barcelona,"I recommend the lamb and beef mains, they were absolutely delicious; the meat was so tender and juicy! One of the best meals we ve had while in Barcelona. The staff were very attentive and managed to accommodate us on what was quite a busy night! Great vibe, definitely recommend."
Viana Barcelona,"One of the best meals I had in my life, I am really surprised its not on the Michlen list, should definitely be there. Im going to let the photos speak for themselves. Definitely would recommend it to anyone, everything was top notch"
Viana Barcelona,The food is speechless and the service is heartwarmingly nice. I would definitely come back
Viana Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"We booked in advance and both took the testing menu. The food was good but not outstanding, the dough on the outside of the cucumber roll was obviously not freshly baked, the tuna tartare was tasty but too warm, the consistency of the chocolate mousse was very good but it tasted mainly of cream and little of chocolate. The restaurant was very full, a little too full for the space and therefore very noisy. The service was very attentive and very quick, but you got the feeling that you were being put under time pressure. The menu includes 4-5 starters, something I like very much, but they were served so quickly one after the other that you were barely finished with one and the next one was already in front of you, serving with flags flying, so to speak, straight into the main course without a break. The wine selection is large, but without any information such as vintage, taste, etc. and the service couldnt or didnt want to really help. So all in all not bad but not quite what you would expect from the description. Therefore the rating is more like 3.5 stars than four. Wheelchair accessibility: It is on one level but very narrow."
Viana Barcelona,"Excellent food! a hidden gem in the narrow streets of Barcelona that leaves an unforgettable culinary experience to anyone who visits! Warm atmosphere, kind staff"
Viana Barcelona,"Very nice atmosphere, delicious food and great cocktails. Very reasonably priced as well."
Viana Barcelona,
Viana Barcelona,"Excellent cuisine, very good cocktails, excellent service, environment just a little noisy for my taste. Highly recommended place. Medium/high price, but the quality is worth it."
Viana Barcelona,"The best grilled octopus in the Gothic Quarter. The serving of all the dishes is interesting and there was nothing that we didnt like. Nice interior and very nice service. The prices are not very low, but its worth it."
Viana Barcelona,All of the foods and drinks were amazing. Liked how they served it. Very creative) Stuff is also friendly and sweet. Would visit again for sure.

Tucco Born,Meilleur restaurant de Barcelone
Tucco Born,"Excellent Pasta, very meaty...order the Jarra Magna beer (Draft Magna Beer)"
Tucco Born,"Excellent food, service and treatment of the people who serve tucco. The tour guide recommended them to us and we had a really pleasant surprise, 100% recommended!"
Tucco Born,"My friends and I knew Tucco since it started with a small place in the Gothic area, we loved their pasta, great flavor, made to order and very good prices! With the change of location we have noticed that the quality of the food is not the same as before, but it is still good. On our last visit the owner asked us if we were happy with the food and we let him know that in our opinion the quality was not the same. Seeing that we were not satisfied, he offered us a free sample of the pasta of the day to compensate us and the truth is that we really appreciated the detail! Maybe what we had ordered didnt seem so good to us, but it is still a highly recommended restaurant with very good prices!"
Tucco Born,"Excellent place, meat ravioli stewed in red wine with tuco, the most appetizing and delicious. The dulce de leche cream dessert with cookies is recommended. And very nice decoration. In addition to the service of the very friendly staff. Dietary restrictions: They have a gluten-free option (it is a closed package, not fresh)"
Tucco Born,
Tucco Born,"Very tasty food, nice service, good prices. Totally recommend it"
Tucco Born,Excellence in service and pasta     Guarantee
Tucco Born,"Very disappointing, service was quite slow, atmosphere quite poor and the most disappointing part was the actual food. If you order the veggie burger, be warned that it is NOT a veggie burger but a plant based burger that looks, smells and tastes like meat, which is very different to what a veggie burger should be. Mixed olives were equally disappointing and tasteless. Vegetarian options: Ask for details as vegetarian options may not be what you expect."

Tucco Born,Great flavors in pasta dishes! Kind people in the service! Reasonable prices! Suggested.
Tucco Born,The two pasta dishes we ordered were terrible. The bread was so hard you could throw at a pigeon and kill it. Thankfully the rest of Barcelona s bread isn t this bad. I am not sure why it has over 1k reviews.

Tucco Born,"Visited with my partner for our last evening in Barcelona. Unfortunately, Tucco Born did not live up to our expectations neither in terms of the food nor the service, which was essentially nonexistent. 20 minutes after ordering via their website, we found out that the order did not make it to the kitchen, having to reorder everything again. Took us way longer than expected for a mediocre meal."
Tucco Born,"Good quality price, very good service, very nice place"
Tucco Born,Very good pasta at a reasonable price.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Doesnt pretend to be upscale but its certainly clean and airy.  Numerous options were able to satisfy our varied diets.

Tucco Born,"I completely recommend eating at this place, a nice, familiar place, where the service is excellent and the food is spectacular. It is my first time in Europe and in Spain, my first day and they treated me wonderfully. They immediately recognized that he was from Mexico and began to talk about things consistent with our country. If you are in this beautiful city, I recommend that you stop by to eat or have something at this place. Success Tucco family!"

Also, at our 3rd visit we got offered free coffe/tea. For the price and location, I say its Amazing! Kid-friendliness: Place for kids to play, and special offer designed for kids."
Tucco Born,So good! And fair price
Tucco Born,"The food is simple but very good. The menu selection system may be intimidating at first, but its worth going through to eat well.

Vegetarian options: Loads of vegetarian options as all dishes have available add ons of meat therefore not in the base of the dish
Tucco Born,"I ate pasta and you can combine it, the price is good, my wife ate pizza"
Tucco Born,"Best pasta I ve ever had! This is a seemingly hole in the wall type place we stumbled on. Both the empanadas and pasta were great. They recommended the meat ravioli with mushroom cream sauce and it did not disappoint! Prices are very fair as well, nice relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommend!!"
Tucco Born,I highly recommend trying pasta here. There is a great variety of topping and sauces. Also the price is affordable. Food

Tucco Born,They have a very fun menu to combine your way. The pastas are delicious.... Try them with pesto sauce... highly recommended! You put it together with pasta... sauces. And other additional ones. And dessert! At convenient prices. And an incomparable flavor.

Tucco Born,Super good. Very delicious and at a very good price :)
Tucco Born,Very good. Cheesecake very good
Tucco Born,"Delicious, cheap, homemade,... What more could you ask for in Barcelona. Pasta, dumplings, lasagna,... All exquisite. Good coffee. Free sparkling and still water."
Tucco Born,A pleasant surprise to discover this restaurant that offers fresh pasta. Everything from the bread and focaccia to the meatballs and of course the customizable pasta was delicious. I highlight the excellent attention and the detail of being pet-friendly.
Tucco Born,Heartwarming Italian food with awesome service
Tucco Born,"A place that I thought no longer existed in Barcelona. Although they served us in English because speaking Catalan they thought we were outsiders. The rest is very good, delicious artisanal pasta, a very complete childrens menu. Artisan pastry tiramisu. We ate three (two adults and a child) for 35 euros. The large space with large tables and a small area for the children to play after lunch. A must! We will be back!!"
Tucco Born,Good food and people are very nice. Password to wifi is tuccobcn(Wifi is FreeWifi)
Tucco Born,Food was okay. Nothing special. It would be nice to order by cell phone if you say so when you enter the restaurant otherwise you will wait for free :D homemade noodles are good. Sauce needs more seasoning.
Tucco Born,"The best lasagna I have eaten in Spain so far. It looks like a fast food restaurant, but it is much more than that, maybe they should choose another aesthetic and improve the atmosphere to a more... Luxurious one perhaps. The price was cheap and the food was delicious. Maybe with a more famncy aesthetic they could easily cost 50% more. Kid-friendliness: Baby seats are ready at all times and a stroller can fit without problems. Wheelchair accessibility: There are ramps for wheelchairs and enough space to leave them at your side."

Tucco Born,She delicious pasta prices are very affordable
Tucco Born,Good restaurant. Delicious pasta and sauces. Correct service. Price
Tucco Born,
Tucco Born,
Tucco Born,"The personnel is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. The prices are decent but the food comes with the price. I would not say it is a value-for-money place, as you get what you pay. The pasta was a bit overcooked and the vino de la casa below average. Good option if you are looking some decent and not expensive Italian fast food. If you are looking for high quality you should probably look for something else."
Tucco Born,The girl who served us was very friendly and the food was very delicious and at a great price. I recommend the gnocchi with red pesto.
Tucco Born,
Tucco Born,"Although the way of ordering was strange to us (you first sit at the entrance on a bench until you decide what to eat, then you order and pay for it and then they take you to the table where you will have dinner), whatever we ate was delicious!! Very Nice dishes and many options that you can combine...!"

Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,"Starters, seafood paella and cava sangria for 2 people for 72 euros. No bread, no dessert, no coffee. The paella was delicious. The cava sangria for 17 euros is worth nothing, they dont know how to make it. The staff does not have many considerations. They are there to serve tourists in any way. They are not professionals. They argued with the customers at the opposite table because they asked them for two glasses of tap water after the wine. Bad experience. We will not return."
Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,The food was good but the weiter can touch your body accidentally!!!!!
Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,"Les chipirons avaient le gout de farine. Les aubergines au miel avaient le gout de pate a lhuile au sucre.

Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,"All very good, super paella"
Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,Food was sub par.  The tomatoes on the burrata salad and tomato bread were grainy and flavorless.  The garlic mushroom tapas was basic - like they were dumped out of a can into butter.  My husband was satisfied with his seafood paella which was the reason we came to this restaurant but I ve had much better in America.  The chicken and potatoes were nothing but a frozen fried patty with cheese.  The unseasoned potatoes were ok after a hefty salting.  Would not recommend.

Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,
Restaurant Arrosseria Gaudi,"We didnt like it because we think we were cheated. We ordered the paella, which was really, really tasty. The menu indicates the price of the dish above 20 , but it is not written that 1, 2, 3... or more persons. When I asked the bartender if there would be enough food for 2 people, he assured me that it would be enough, but did not say that we would pay double. We would have ordered paella for 1 person and another dish for the second to try Spanish food. The paella was excellent, the wine recommended by the bartender was also excellent, but the amount of the check was surprising. We can pay more, but next time we wont be fooled and will find out before ordering. We recommend it to other customers as well."

Restaurant Centfocs,Spectacular cuisine and top-notch service in the heart of Barcelona. At night quieter than at midday. Totally recommended.
Restaurant Centfocs,"As always, good."
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"Its been a while since I went to this restaurant and I see that they continue in their line, being a classic for locals and tourists who visit the area. The daily menu is approximately  16, with dishes with generous and delicious portions. The waiters are correct, the maitred is very top and she has everything under control. To add a but, the dishes took a long time to come out (understandable being a Friday at noon) and the light is somewhat poor."
Restaurant Centfocs,"As word spread about that days lunch set menu del dia, people start lining up before 1 p.m. Good food and atmosphere for the price. Compared to Korean restaurants charging 17 euros for a stew, how hard do they do their best? I recommend it."
Restaurant Centfocs,"A lot has changed since my last visit to this restaurant, terrible service, they should be nicer to customers"
Restaurant Centfocs,"Kid-friendliness: Es un local un poco justo en algunos puntos del mismo , con ninos es dificil de controlar Food"
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"This restaurant is recommended if you want to taste authentic menu del dia. Its not the best restaurant in Barcelona, but considering the price, its the best! It seems to be a restaurant frequented by locals. Personally, the gnocchi and fish menu were very delicious :)"

Restaurant Centfocs,"Mixes grilled vegetables. Je pense que les aubergines ont connu la guerre, je pense meme qu elles l ont perdu. La tomate esseulee dans une assiette sur laquelle elle siegeait telle une reine , mais apres decapitation. Que dire de l oignon. Prenez le cru, et posez le dans l assiette , ca ajoutera de la couleur au pire. Restent les deux asperges qui seules dans cet ocean d horreur ne parvenaient pas a sortir la tete de l eau dans laquelle elles ont prealablement cuite je pense. Quant aux pains a la tomate typique de l Espagne, je pense que c est une insulte a toute une nation, a son histoire, son patrimoine que de servir ca a des clients. A y avait des courgettes aussi en victimes collaterales d une bataille a laquelle elles ne voulaient meme pas participer. Bref: a eviter."
Restaurant Centfocs,Very rich
Restaurant Centfocs,"Excellent restaurant, menu quality price! Spectacular Thursday paella on the menu! Wheelchair accessibility: On the ground floor!"
Restaurant Centfocs,"Many years have passed and this restaurant continues to offer quality, speed and good dishes in a restaurant in the heart of the center. Reservations are necessary as it is always full. Menu price of the day  16.10 with many proposals to choose from."
Restaurant Centfocs,"The taste is not bad. Those of you who say this restaurant is delicious, what kind of tongue do you have? There was no English menu, so I could barely tell what was on the menu using Papago, which has a low-quality Spanish translation. In fact, it can be seen as buffet quality, with food prepared in advance and served in large quantities. The price is relatively cheap compared to other restaurants in downtown Bothel, but for this price, the quality of the Five Guys hamburgers is much better. Its true that the employees dont speak English, but there are no English menus so its not easy to know whats on the menu, and everyone is unfriendly except for one male employee who looks a bit tall. Oh, just dont go there. Seriously, my companions unanimously agreed that it was a trash restaurant and the most trashy meal I had in Spain."
Restaurant Centfocs,"The steak was really tender and delicious, the pasta was clean and good, and the sangria was the best I had in Barcelona. I really want to go again."
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"Went there after having seen the restaurant advised in a blog. It is lovely! I went there with my sister in the evening, very relaxed atmosphere, with chill music in the background and a clean feel to everything. The food was very very good. Both paella and pork were excellent. I am very satisfied with everything. I will come back!"
Restaurant Centfocs,A place where you can eat a generous menu del dia
Restaurant Centfocs,Ive been there 3 times and I love it again. Its very big...and there were a lot of people. Maybe Ill pull that back... But for me it wasnt a problem. I really liked the food. Menu approximately  17.p/p

Restaurant Centfocs,"Restaurant close to Pelai and Placa Catalunya, suitable for large group meals due to the space and agility of the staff. They offer a  30 a la carte or menu (including Saturday night), which I think is quite a success. The menu offers several first courses, second courses and desserts, although some of them have a supplement. We tried the tomato salad with mozzarella - nice detail to peel the tomato and add pine nuts - and the escalivada with goat cheese, both delicious dishes. As a second course, we tried the baked sea bream, the entrails and the fricando with wild rice. The three dishes were excellently cooked and very generous in quantity. Very good oil. For dessert, the thousand sheets of cream and the mojito sorbet, both correct. Correct presentation and very friendly treatment. You can pay by card"
Restaurant Centfocs,Safe bet if you want to eat well in the center and with a menu. Sometimes there are many people waiting at the entrance who get to the first tables.
Restaurant Centfocs,"Everything perfect, food, service, and atmosphere. The best thing is that they dont make you wait even if you dont have a reservation."
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"We were eating the menu of the day Perfect price quality All dishes well prepared I highlight the baked sea bass, very delicious. Friendly staff although they are a little overwhelmed, normal, given the large influx of diners Congratulations"
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"A very good option for dining in a large and small group. Large and very well adapted room. The decoration is practically the same as the first day, even so, it has its charm. The treatment received was correct and very fast in serving the dishes. There is a menu with supplementary dishes although there is variety along with an extensive menu. We had a tomato salad (they had flavor!) and the entrails were also very good tasting and well cooked. We will surely repeat and I hope they do not lower the quality and maintain it over the years."
Restaurant Centfocs,"A place to repeat, both for the quality of the food and for the kindness and good treatment received. I was very pleasantly surprised by this quality in the center of the city. Thanks for everything."
Restaurant Centfocs,Cannelloni and entrecote very good. The dessert didnt quite convince me.

Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"It is probably one of the restaurants in Barcelona that I have been to the most, I think that says a lot. They have made a thousand changes over the years but they still have a very complete menu with many options to choose from, varied and good. The price is also very good if you consider the quality and the location (very well located in the center of Bcn). The schedule is also very full. The only thing to criticize is that it is very noisy and sometimes it is difficult to maintain a conversation with your partner. Also, for my taste, the tables are too close together. Vegetarian options: There is always more than one option on the menu. I dont remember exactly everything that was there, but I do remember the seitan, salad (without tuna, etc.), ..."

Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,Its a shame that you go to dinner at a restaurant and they treat you as if they were doing you a favor. Terrible and reportable attention. Certainly the last time we have our annual family celebration at this restaurant.
Restaurant Centfocs,"It wasnt bad, nor was it good, normal, but that doesnt mean it was a bad experience, maybe the subway without windows made me have that perception."
Restaurant Centfocs,"Nothing out of this world, at least its not very expensive"
Restaurant Centfocs,Really good. (Pity so much noise.)
Restaurant Centfocs,"100% recommendable, daily menu very good quality-price, treatment and professionalism of the waiters a 10, cozy restaurant and retro-modern style, which reminds me of the luxury restaurants of before, spacious, clean, excellent food, mix between Designer food, but abundant... Thank you very much, keep up the good work. We will repeat for sure."
Restaurant Centfocs,"Good restaurant with normal food but of very good quality. We went on a weekend, menu with starter, main course, dessert and drink  30. The cannelloni is highly recommended. The service was a little slow but you have to understand that the restaurant was full so there was also a bit of noise. Vegetarian options: There were several vegan dishes, salads, vegetable cream... Kid-friendliness: Allows children"
Restaurant Centfocs,Service is friendly but it took 1/2 hour between first and second on New Years Eve. The rest all very well
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"I went to eat at Centfocs with a friend two days ago, and I was very disappointed, it is no longer the Centfocs that I remembered. Apart from the fact that there are an excess of diners, and it is very uncomfortable to eat with so many tables so close together, the food is no longer what it was, it has lost the quality and flavor of yesteryear. I hope the owners reconsider their objectives, or else they will, as they say, die of success. I, of course, will think twice before returning. a shame"
Restaurant Centfocs,A good place to make the daily menu.Classic decoration.Fast and friendly service.To my taste too many tables for the space but they have to make the price profitable.
Restaurant Centfocs,"I would say the value for money is the strong point of this beautiful restaurant. It is definitely not for tourists and is the best in the area. Aesthetically very well decorated with a soft, right and welcoming light. The dishes are excellent, both the meat and the paella.... Excellent quality of typical Spanish wines to accompany a top Catalan culinary choice. Service in line with what a place like this requires, even if a little too formal. Excellent restaurant...not to be missed..!"
Restaurant Centfocs,A summary: Food 5/5  and very good price quality. Service: 5/5   very attentive and professional Atmosphere: 5/5 .
Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,All very well. It was too crowded and quite noisy. The rest is very good
Restaurant Centfocs,"Risotto: ok Salad: ok Braised oxtail: fantastic taste Monkfish dish: fantastic. The fish tastes like it has been cooked. You can smell it from other tables as well. I dont know if it was originally cooked like this or if the fish was in a strange condition that day. However, when I asked to change it, they coolly changed it without charging me any money. Pork ribs I received in exchange: considerable. It was delicious on a similar level to braised oxtail. Dessert: Personally, I like to eat small amounts of intensely sweet desserts, so my desserts were just plain, but I know there are many people who like to eat a lot of sweet things in moderation. Best for those people. Overall: Everything was fine, but the monkfish... It was too serious... Maybe it was just luck with the menu drawing..."

Restaurant Centfocs,
Restaurant Centfocs,"The restaurant has become terrible and does not meet the expectations it had one day! The only decent thing was the salad...the entrecote meat, dry and bad, the croquettes were not homemade and the paella looked like something from a school cafeteria. This restaurant It is no longer what it was. I will not return. The carrot cake is a dry industrial cake (dont ask for it) and the profiteroles are like the ones served in any wok"

The Green Spot,"New favorite place in Barcelona!!! Beautiful interiors, cozy and chic. Great fresh tasty food, with a lot of variety. Black pizza is a must! Great selection of natural wines. Only note: music selection didnt fit, could be more elevated."

The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Fantastic! Change of menu and more intimate atmosphere. Super recommended, in groups and as a couple."
The Green Spot,"I went yesterday to try the new menu and I loved it!!! The truth is that it is one or, if not, the best vegan restaurant in BCN. I recommend the ceviche, the sandwich, the kale chips, and some dumplings stuffed with vegetables. A 10"
The Green Spot,"Excellent experience, as I have always attended. Very good food in an exceptional place"
The Green Spot,

The Green Spot,One of the best vegetarians Ive been to in Barcelona. The ceviche and risottos are highly recommended. Also the mushroom sandwich.
The Green Spot,Excellent vegetarian dishes
The Green Spot,"Many recommend the sweet potato Tagliatelle but the portion is tiny and it is not spectacular either, they should put it as a starter not as a main. The star beer comes in 20cc!! If you dont want to stay hungry, order a pizza, they are very good"
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"The place is very nice, ideal for going on a date or a quiet dinner. Excellent food for those who like to try things and especially vegetarian and vegan foods, we paired the food with a cava that was delicious. Vegetarian options: The place is only vegetarian and vegan food."

The Green Spot,"I went several times already. The atmosphere is spectacular. All with great taste. The service is very good. Food I have had good days and bad days. In the bad ones, everything was very lacking in flavor. Ill try one more time"
The Green Spot,"We ordered the talgiatelle de boniato, but it s very disappointing that this is not pasta but just grated sweet potato. Paying 17,50 to eat sweet potato is too expensive and it was not very tasty. Then we also ordered the black pizza with goat cheese, it did not say on the menu that the pizza also had cow s cheese. Please put this on the menu because my friend is allergic specifically to cow s milk, and therefore couldn t eat the pizza. We were glad that she got another pizza. But after that the service was very bad because no one came to our table anymore. We finished our drinks but no one asked if we wanted something else to drink. Then we wanted to pay and it took 15 min before we got the bill. Then another 15 min before we could actually pay by card. 30 min of waiting unnecessary while we already wanted to leave. A very unpleasant experience. Way too expensive for the service you receive."
The Green Spot,"Good attention, very friendly. The food, well, I think that vegetables without so much dressing and sugar are sometimes tastier and healthier. I also found a hair on the plate but hey, everything is fine."
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Good atmosphere, service fine but food was horrible. The gluten free pizza tasted like a frozen pizza in worse, the yuca brava lacked taste. And the quesadilla horrible. Couldnt be finished. The fresh juice is actually from a bottle..."
The Green Spot,Delicious- especially the croquettes. Lots of variety and flavour. Staff very helpful.
The Green Spot,Great place for vegetarians traveling to Barcelona
The Green Spot,"Beautiful space.  Dynamite eggplant, truffle pizza and chocolate cake.  Friendly staff"
The Green Spot,"Inspired menu with creative vegan and vegetarian options. Buckwheat pizza was excellent, including plant based chorizo sauce that was spiced perfectly and lotus root that made the dish shine.  The dining room was very short staffed. The servers were hustling and did the best they could but with only two of them for a pretty full dining room, there were a number of issues with getting food and drinks to our table. Vegetarian options: The menu is full of options with many creative dishes I havent seen before."
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Truly enjoyed my evening here, it was delicious and was very glad to eat all vegan and enjoy the food so much. The ambience is cozy, elegant and modern at the same time. The staff was very quick, helpful and precise. However the entree with the mushroom and eggplant I was definitely expecting a bit more. I feel like it needed something else in there to give it more texture and not just purely the mushiness of the eggplant and chewiness of the mushroom, these textures without a crunch get a bit tiring after a while, especially since the plate is quite large for an entree. Following I had the Jack fruit tacos and these were the star of the night. Delicious tacos, presented in a stylish way and so so yummy. To end I had the pasta which I couldn t resist to order although I was already a bit full. However the flavors were excellent, I loved the macadamia sauce, but when I read sweet potato tagliatelle I am expecting tagliatelle, not raw or blanched sweet potato strips  although they were tasty but tbh I think a nice real sweet potato tagliatelle without the egg, could have been better. Overall I definitely suggest this restaurant for anyone who s interested in vegan options or is a true vegan, you will enjoy it, I guarantee that."
The Green Spot,"The food excellent. In our case we ordered some cassava bravas, some buds with kimchi, some mini tacos and some sweet potato spaghetti that we couldnt finish. The portions are perfect to share between two. Attentive, professional and friendly staff. The place is very nice. Perhaps some tables were too attached to the others and the conversations were mixed. But I would definitely repeat it again. A treat for the palate!"
The Green Spot,"The perfect restaurant for a dinner as a couple or with friends. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the food is spectacular. I recommend plates to share as starters instead of the main dishes, which have smaller portions. Be sure to try the tempura of buds marinated in kimchi, they were the star of the night."
The Green Spot,"Edamame was the best i ve ever had. Jackfruit tacos and tempeh had so many flavors. Staff was friendly, attentive, professional. Would recommend 10/10"
The Green Spot,"Im not much of a vegetarian, but everything is scandalous"
The Green Spot,"Lovely ambience, attentive service, and great food & wine. It was great not having to worry about shellfish allergy for once in Barcelona"

The Green Spot,"A relaxed meal trying different dishes. Vegan, gluten free. Everything perfect"
The Green Spot,The bonitoto noodles with  truffle  did not have a hint of truffle. We mentioned it to the manager who became very defensive and very unpleasant. It was the company lunch and we had been celebrating it there for several years but we will not return for sure.
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Very cozy atmosphere, large space and very well decorated. The food is very good, although we find it expensive Vegetarian options: There are many vegan dishes Dietary restrictions: There are gluten-free and lactose-free options."
The Green Spot,Great food Vegetarian options: All plates are vegetarian Food : 5/5 |
The Green Spot,"Amazing food, bursting with flavor and chilled vibes with cool music Quesadillas were amazing, black pizza had that great mix of sweet and savory and very tasty cacio e Pepe Croquetas were some of the best we ve ever had We will be back"
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"The food is delicious, but the musical selection does not fit the place and the volume does not allow for a friendly conversation. The last two times we have gone we have been equally uncomfortable and I dont think we will return. Vegetarian options: I really liked their battered buds Parking: We managed to park in front of the restaurant after a long wait."
The Green Spot,"The place is very nice, cozy and with good acoustics. The delicious food!!! to eat vegan, super delicious!!! Vegetarian options: Sweet potato pasta with macadamia cream and truffle"
The Green Spot,Super recommended! Food 10. Staff 10. Local 10. We will definitely return!
The Green Spot,Excellent place for vegans and non-vegans. We had a company dinner there and we were all very happy. Different food that I dont usually find in other restaurants. The delicious pizzas. Serve of ten. I will return for sure!
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Food is great, maybe a bit overpriced but still great. Many gluten free and vegan options. Staff is friendly and nice and the place is beautiful."
The Green Spot,"One of my favorite restaurants! And not from my best vegetarians, but from my best food places in the world. The tagliatelle are delicious, and the desserts are wonderful. Congratulations!"

The Green Spot,Great vegan mains and starters but vegan desert/cakes so dry and tasteless
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,Great veggie/vegan place. The good is amazing but the portions are small and a bit overpriced.
The Green Spot,We loved it. Food 10 and service 10. All very good. We will be back.
The Green Spot,"The menu is unusual and the dishes are also very tasty. High prices, but absolutely fair for the quality of the food. We felt it was a shame that the service wasnt up to par. Rather disinterested in the guest, no questions etc."
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,As a vegan it was a fantastic find offering delicious and affordable food for me and my partner. My partners not vegan but still enjoyed every bite! The service was wonderful and the ambience so cosy and welcoming. A great place to eat for the vegan/veggie/non veggie alike! Vegetarian options: Vegan and veggie options only
The Green Spot,"Very good vegetarian restaurant, very good service and generous portions. One for the price but I would repeat."
The Green Spot,"We went a week ago. -Very appetizing food with a lot to choose from. It is a restaurant made for vegetarian people since they have not specialized much in making it suitable for people who have never tried vegetarianism to adapt to the food (the dishes do not try to imitate food from a normal diet). In that aspect it could be improved although the dishes, even though they are far from what someone would eat on a normal day, are delicious, many flavors and very good for vegetarians. -Very friendly and attentive service. Explaining what each meal was in detail  nothing to complain about. -Minimalist but cozy atmosphere at the same time, music... all perfect to enjoy a slightly different meal. Prices around  15/ 20 per dish, portions a little small for the price but not much, I recommend getting a starter for every 2 people you have. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian food and about half the menu is also vegan."
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Good atmosphere, good design, good service, but the best is the product and the way it is cooked, a totally recommended vegetarian."

The Green Spot,"Uno de mis restaurantes favoritos en Barcelona. El lugar es super acogedor, la comida buenisima y el trato excelente. Dietary restrictions: Gluten"
The Green Spot,"Good and well prepared food, service and atmosphere"
The Green Spot,"Great vegetarian restaurant with many vegan options.  Fairly simple food, well made.  Prices are reasonable given the high quality.  Serving sizes are moderate, so you have room for two or three courses.  Decent cocktail program as well.  Friendly service. Kid-friendliness: They offered to make kid friendly pizza and pasta off menu without our even asking."
The Green Spot,"Made a reservation for Christmas 4 months in advance, wich was confirmed by the restaurant. On Christmas we found the restaurant closed, so we stood there with the whole family. Not very kind not to let us know and cancel the reservation. Sent an email, but they didnt reply. Therefore now this review. Unreliable."
The Green Spot,"The manager Valentina is very friendly, cordial and enthusiastic! The food a 10! Excellent and highly recommended"
The Green Spot,
The Green Spot,"Easily one of the best vegetarian options in Barcelona when it comes to location, seating and overall ambience. But it s not just that, the food and service are very good too. And it s open till late. I was a repeat customer and highly recommended this place to many others. On the downsides, they could have real fresh juices instead of small bottled juices. Vegetarian options: All vegetarian and some vegan options"
The Green Spot,Quality vegetarian food
The Green Spot,Vegetarian options: Lots of vegan dishes Dietary restrictions: Lots of gluten-free and vegan dishes
The Green Spot,"This place is a must try for both vegans and non-vegans. Inviting ambiance, very attentive and friendly service, and well crafted food. The dishes are not only visually stunning but burst with flavors! Even our non vegan friend loved the veg options! I d be delighted to come back. Highly recommend when in BCN."
The Green Spot,"The best vegan restaurant in Barcelona. Classy, quality and just overall sophisticated vibe"
The Green Spot,"Great food, great atmosphere. Highly recommended."
The Green Spot,Food was good and a lot of  non-fake-meat vegetarian and vegan options. Nice cocktail list. Wait staff was nice but food came out very (too) quickly and they tried to rush us out the door.
The Green Spot,"Best food in Barcelona coming from someone who eats everything. Service is good, atmosphere is great. The dishes are creative and tasty and I haven t had anything here I wasn t blown away with. Tons of gluten free options too."

The Green Spot,"I rarely give 5/5, but this was exceptional. Not perfect, but I left very happy and would happily come back. Cauliflower cacio e pepe - star of the show. Initially wasnt impressed by the shaved cauliflower bits on top. I had low expectations:  nice restaurants in Rome and Florence didnt have good pasta (the cheap lunch places did). Pasta was cooked perfectly. Large portion. Croquettes - tasty, but lukewarm. I didnt ask my waiter to reheat. Fried cauliflower - suggest skipping. The menu didnt say they were fried, but thats fine. I also didnt realize cauliflower was in 2/3 dishes   It was fried and battered well, but my issue is the sauce. The flavor profile is Vietnamese. In hindsight, its obvious. Its basically Vietnamese hoisin spring roll sauce-the sweetness, color, texture, same. And there wasnt enough!   I ate the last 4 pieces with no sauce. Not impressed. Good value. My bill was ~35  (no alcohol). In Chicago, Id pay 60  for the same thing. Nice decor, atmosphere, great music. Perfect for a date or night out. Staff was friendly, spoke English, and food came quick. Multiple people came to check on my food, cleared plates. All very nice. Got seated immediately ~9pm on a Friday. The restaurant was ~60% full."

The Green Spot,"Small quantity, very normal quality and very high prices. To try but not return. Years ago I went there and had in my mind a good experience. Too bad its not the same..."
The Green Spot,Food is nice and many options for vegetarians. It s is little costly due to middle of the city.

Teleferic,
Teleferic,"Delicious food, wonderful drinks. I found the environment a little too bright, dull, lacking atmosphere. Lighting needs to change."
Teleferic,"Its completely for tourists. The paella doesnt even have a crispy rice crust, and the shrimps are also frozen. I vomited four times that night after eating paella and my stomach was very uncomfortable"
Teleferic,"Wonderful dinner here! We ordered the shishito peppers, smoked aubergine, pork trotters croquettes, crispy tuna tacos, and a squid ink paella (along with many tasty drinks). Definitely recommend the tacos and any paella - you cant go wrong. Our waitress Gemma was so kind and helpful, she really made the whole experience memorable!"

Teleferic,Nice experience dinning here and the staff where exceptionally friendly. One of the only restaurants in the area that is child friendly with a baby chair. Paella was a bit pricy (40 euro for 2 people).
Teleferic,"Hot food at any time, friendly and fast, good food, inexpensive lunch menu, very good tapes"
Teleferic,Teleferic provided a wonderful experience as our first dinner in Barcelona. Taula was incredibly helpful and gave us recommendations upon request which were fantastic. The seafood paella was incredibly and the roasted tomato tapas

Teleferic,Valentina pro.finansy. Food very tasty
Teleferic,Not a lot of choice on the menu. A few tapas and it went up to 30 per pax.. Not worth the money i would say. That being said what we ate was good
Teleferic,"Good and tasty tapas, soft and expensive aubergines with burrata, soft currants in barbecue sauce, they fall completely off the bone... must try... very good tacos"
Teleferic,
Teleferic,

Teleferic,Well prepared and delicious tapas
Teleferic,"The best place we visited, in a hidden little street, yet in the heart of the city center. We ate amazingly delicious food in a cozy, beautiful environment.  The wait staff is simply fantastic  we will definitely come back here again when we come here."
Teleferic,The food was amazing and Ainhoa was a great waitress! Definitely recommend this spot for a lunch or dinner
Teleferic,"Nous avons mange en couple hier midi. Tout etait bon ! Gros coup de c ur pour les croquettes calamars et le poulpe patate douce / truffe. Merci beaucoup a Jemma pour son accueil, sa gentillesse et ses conseils. Au plaisir de vous revoir ! Beyza & Imran"
Teleferic,Great service and a nice atmosphere. Defined a nice place to dine in.
Teleferic,"Service impeccable, food was unlike anything Id ever had. The steak brioche and the aubergine & burrata were the standouts. Tuna tartare taco was delicious also."
Teleferic,Gemma was amazing!
Teleferic,Excellent quality. Traditional cuisine. Good service and pleasant atmosphere. Everything we ate was very well executed and with an excellent presentation. Correct plate size.
Teleferic,
Teleferic,"My First Day in Barcelona Was Made Unforgettable by Teleferic Landing in Barcelona, with its streets echoing tales of old and new, I was a solo traveler with a heart full of wanderlust and an empty stomach. On my very first evening, I stumbled upon Teleferic, and let me tell you, it felt like striking culinary gold. Walking in, the vibe of the place wrapped around me like a warm hug. There s something about the ambiance that s just so inviting, making a solo diner like me feel right at home. It was bustling yet comfortable, lively yet intimate a perfect blend of everything I didnt know I needed. Enter Gemma, the star of the evening (apart from the food, of course). Fluent in English and with a kindness thats rare, she navigated me through the menu with the ease of a friend suggesting their favorites. Each dish she recommended was like a piece of Barcelona on a plate, and for a moment, I felt less like a tourist and more like a local. The tapas oh, the tapas! Every bite of the Crispy Tuna Tartare Tacos and Pork Ribs was a revelation, a blend of flavors so divine, I couldn t help but savor each bite as if it were my last. And just when I thought it couldn t get any better, the dessert arrived, sweeping me off my feet all over again. Dining alone in a new city can be daunting, but Teleferic turned it into an adventure. My first day in Barcelona ended with a belly full of amazing food and a heart full of gratitude. If you ever find yourself wandering the streets of this enchanting city, make your way to Teleferic. It s not just a meal; it s an experience a deliciously unforgettable one at that."
Teleferic,Its a good idea to book before you go. Tapas and paella restaurant. The dishes are different and everything we ate was very good. The truffled croquette was spectacular. I highly recommend it!
Teleferic,
Teleferic,I found this place randomly by checking the reviews with restaurants nearby our hotel and the whole experience was amazing   I was in Barcelona for work and I couldn t see much from the city but I enjoyed my dinners at Teleferic! I went three days in a row and ate Tuna Tartar and other tapas! And dessert   Absolutely amazing! I took all my colleagues there and everyone loved the place. Valentina was very sweet and attentive. Although I didn t have a chance to fell in love with Barcelona but Teleferic is definitely my crush from this trip and I will come back there again!
Teleferic,"The service, atmosphere & food was incredible!"
Teleferic,We went to dinner. The atmosphere was cozy and quite minimalist with very friendly staff. The food is very good. The only drawback I found is that it can be a little expensive for what is offered.
Teleferic,
Teleferic,
Teleferic,Great fast and tasty
Teleferic,"I was very happy to have been able to visit this restaurant in Barcelona! Very warm service! Since I was only going, I think it was easy to find a table because the first thing they ask is if you have a reservation! I ordered the smoked eggplant with burrata and it was truly spectacular! As well as the tuna tacos! Highly recommended!"
Teleferic,"Nice vibes and excellent service. The food and drink are amazing. I definitely will come back for meal next time when I visit Barcelona. One thing I really appreciate is that when my girlfriend fainted, the service gave me an instant help and called for ambulance. Now, she is fine and I really appreciate it."
Teleferic,"Very nice yummy fine tapas, good service"
Teleferic,"Very good atmosphere and super attentive staff. Everything has come very quickly. The Gyosa had an excess of sauce, but very good... and the meat had a bitter point because it had been burned a little on the grill. But it was well made. Mahons fritters  SPECTACULAR!!!! ;-)"
Teleferic,"It was awesome :-) Nice place, food and friendly and helpful service Food"
Teleferic,"Incredibly lovely service and fantastic food in a beautifully decorated space. We loved it from start to finish! We enjoyed tuna tartar tacos, Mahon cheese fritters with citrus honey and lime zest, their patatas bravas, pan con tomato, and paella with rabbit. All excellent! Fabulous experienced. Thank you Teleferic!"
Teleferic,
Teleferic,Everything excellent!!
Teleferic,
Teleferic,Feom the minute we walked it attention to detail was impecable food so yummy.
Teleferic,"Alejandro, Gemma and Carlos service was wonderful! Really made the night and delicious meal spectacular! We weren t sure what to order, so they gave us the chef s choice or menu. This is when the chef creates a special order specifically for you.. even dishes in a certain order. They also helped us chose the wine to go with the meals. We felt like royalty. Thank you, Teleferic, for the delicious meal, personal wine and fantastic dessert  and wonderful service team!"
Teleferic,Food was outstanding. Tuna tacos were amazing as was the service. Carlos and Gemma were attentive and provided excellent service.
Teleferic,Outstanding!!! The food was amazing. We found Teleferic by accident. The restaurant is beautiful. The tuna tacos and solomillo were delicious. Really fun place. Shout out too to our servers Gemma and Carlos. They were so hospitable and helpful. Do not miss this find!
Teleferic,"Octopus was amazing, black paella was also excellent. The wine was good and the cheesecake dessert was interesting."

Teleferic,The waitresses Valentina and Iris were very nice and gave us good information about food and drinks. Thanks to all
Teleferic,The friendliness of the waiters and Mahons fritters make the restaurant stand out completely. Not to mention the sandwich or the octopus. Toodo out of 10!
Teleferic,Valentina and Iris tried very hard and helped to choose good dishes. They also tasted great Thanks!
Teleferic,Valentina was really welcoming! Loved the restaurant!
Teleferic,Restaurant was recommended to us by our driver. I will say it was awesome experience. Amazing food friendly staff (especially Valentina  ). I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Barcelona.
Teleferic,Great service and even better food. We asked for them to select the tapas for us on our selected budget per person and we were provided a great selection. Definitely recommend.
Teleferic,
Teleferic,Came for dinner in a big group - amazing restraunt. Served by a lovely waitress Gemma!
Teleferic,Best food we had in Barcelona at a reasonable price. We received amazing service from Gemma!

Vinitus,"Review on 2024: i visit this tapa house again.  I am disappointed..  food quality dropped a lot.  Scarlet shrimp is way undercooked  and razor clam is tasteless.  We had razor clam a wewk ago in Lisbon and it was delicious.   Somehow, here is tastless.  Its either not fresh or poached before fried.... not sure.  Others are average. Review on 2019: Excellent service and food.  They are very friendly, make me feels so happy as a tourist.  Btw, their seafood is one of the best in Spain. The red prawn is a must try, much better then other so call fine dining restaurant.  Maybe smaller but taste much better."
Vinitus,"We are here this evening as a family of 4 and it was a fantastic dinner. We had many of the starters and main dishes with our favorites being the veggie options (asparagus & mushrooms and the Brussel sprouts), the chicken croquettes, and Iberian ham flautas. We also had a few of the desserts and they were all delicious. Our service was excellent and we would definitely return. A great dinner for a very reasonable price recommended by our friends at Live Life Barcelona!"
Vinitus,Codfish was delicious :)
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"The staff was very cheerful. They sang songs next to me and hummed along. I had honey cod and calamari fried squid here, and both were full of happiness. I was happy. I also tried calsot, and up to 2 were delicious, but anything more than that was a bit bitter haha... I ate churros as dessert, and the chocolate was very thick and delicious."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"I ate three types: honey cod, omelet, and foie gras. The honey cod was soft and sweet, so anyone could enjoy it. The foie gras was very soft and tasty, but it was also an ingredient that I personally found repulsive, so I think I only tried one or two bites. If youre not looking to fill up, it seems like a place where you can enjoy decent food at a reasonable price."
Vinitus,"We felt amazing! I ate 6 people full and drank 10 beers, 2 pints and paid  120. The food was delicious!"
Vinitus,I like the cod. It was good.
Vinitus,"One-line review: This guy s honey cod, honey cod, really~ In conclusion, the honey cod was delicious. Ever since I said I was going to Barcelona from Korea, Ive heard so much about how delicious the honey cod is. Just hearing the sound of that damn honey cod made me irritated, but it was delicious. The combination of sweet and salty with the sourness of tomatoes, the chewiness of slightly dried cod, and the umami of garlic made it quite perfect (the exact name is cod with honey aioli sauce). This seems to be the first store, but unlike the second store, if you type the name in Korean, it doesnt come out, so it seems like its hard to see Korean people. I ordered a variety of other dishes as well. 1. Grilled mat clams: It was about 11 euros, but I was disappointed that it was a bit bland and lacked searing. The clams themselves are very delicious, but if you want to eat a decent one, you have to pay at least 20 euros for a bowl, or you can only eat 3 or 4 pieces. 2. Fried red pepper: A non-spicy vegetable that s good to eat as a side. 3. Grilled beef and foie gras: The beef was quite delicious and went well with the bread, but the foie gras was a bit fishy. It would have been much better if it had just beef or peppers. 4. Grilled shrimp and squid skewers: This was quite good value for money. If I hadnt decided not to order it again after eating it once, I would have eaten it again. 5. Pan Conto Mate: I ordered it because it was so basic, but it was tasteless and not very sincere. 6. Calamari: This one was also very delicious. Squid with thin breadcrumbs and exquisite liver. It was very delicious 7. Shrimp Squid Croquette: I ordered it because it was todays menu and it was quite delicious. It was quite filling as there were pieces of seafood inside. 8. Grilled Kalsot: A dish that looks like Korean green onions and is made by roasting them in the oven. Although it had sweet vegetable juice, it had a very soft texture. However, it is a bit difficult to eat alone and it takes a while to come out compared to other dishes, so you will need to allocate your time well. It was about 75 euros for eating like this and 3 drinks, so it wasnt bad."
Vinitus,A friendly and pleasant place! The food was a little salty but delicious.
Vinitus,"Good tapas, best place for the typical catalan dessert Torrija. Vegetarian options."
Vinitus,"Came here on Sunday around 4pm. There were quite a few lines. Give your name to the clerk in charge of the order. Japanese names are pronounced like Spanish, so I didnt notice when they called me. I should have said Mario. Once you order, your food and drinks will come right away. The churros were not fried properly and were raw in the middle. Its noisy, so its not the kind of atmosphere where you can have a leisurely meal."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is nice, and the prices are good! From the reviews, it seems like waiting is necessary, but if you have a good bar table, youll get a good seat. I heard that there are many shops that do not make paella themselves but instead serve it frozen. This place has an open kitchen, so you can see it being made right away, which also contributes to the good atmosphere."
Vinitus,"Good quality food, tasty desserts, correct service, we put a but to the 33 cm bottle of MINERAL WATER that for the price could be larger and the queue on the street, as there is no option to reserve."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"The tapas are great, the place is very central and the waiter Cris is wonderful, friendly and attentive, a pleasure that the place has such professional employees. I recommend it"
Vinitus,Good food and atmosphere of Barcelona
Vinitus,"Regular in both Vinitus locations but this one I prefer as I think it has nicer interior and typically shorter wait times for tables. Dani the waiter is always excellent, attentive, happy, and helpful with ordering. Really makes it an enjoyable experience, especially as 24 year old tourist who often is treated poorly in other restaurants. It s the best value dinner restaurant I have been in Barcelona when considering: food, atmosphere and price whereby I always spend 25-40 euros pp when eating with a group."
Vinitus,Food was amazing.
Vinitus,The ravioli with Gorgonzola was delicious the ambiance is great and very affordable for a classy meal !
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"Prepared fresh and quickly, its really fun to watch in the open kitchen. Super good, super friendly!"
Vinitus,Very tasty dishes but small portions and expensive
Vinitus,"My first time at Vinitus, cozy place, excellent food, fast service and very good attention from the waitress Angeli!!! We will repeat!!!"
Vinitus,"Very good tapas, made from high quality ingredients and generous portions of toppings on the montaditos."
Vinitus,So good! Get the tuna tartare!
Vinitus,"I visited around 12 oclock and was able to eat right away without waiting. All the staff are really friendly and makes me feel good. The atmosphere was nice and clean! The octopus is really delicious, and I recommend the honey cod!"
Vinitus,"I gave myself the opportunity to visit this place, I had been told about it, but I had paid little attention. We arrive and sign up, since there is a line to enter (it depends on the time) When we sat down we ordered a bottle of wine and then we ordered some hot tapas, the meat with fuet and the shrimp skewers, both were very delicious, then we ordered the octopus casserole and an omelet. The octopus casserole was not at all successful, it was more sweet potato than octopus and the tortilla was very dry for my taste. The coconut flan was good. The place has a good atmosphere, but it seems to me that it is more for tourists. Its price is high and I dont see a real appeal in it."
Vinitus,"Actually enjoyed most of the tapas. Came alone sat at the bar. Seafood was really fresh. The only food item that wasn t to my liking was the steak with foie gras. Steak was quite hard to get through, and foie gras wasn t the best. But for the price that s the quality. Just not my personal taste."
Vinitus,"We went here several times during our stay! At first it seemed a bit hectic, but all the staff were very warm, friendly, helpful, patient and cheerful. The food was really great! Only recommended! Unfortunately you cant make a reservation, so you have to wait or be lucky. Wed love to come back!"
Vinitus,
Vinitus,One of my favorite restaurants in the world! Friendly fun staff and amazing food! Highly recommend! Headed back tomorrow!
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"We are regulars and we are always satisfied, the good food and the 10 service never fails, especially when Edison serves you, he is very friendly and attentive, my congratulations and a thousand thanks for the excellent service. Everything 100 as always"
Vinitus,"Delightful lunch of Turbot, grilled vegetables and Torrija cremada de Sta. Teresa (16th century) for pudding. Excellent in every way."
Vinitus,"The staff is spectacular, we are from Lleida and every time we go to Barcelona for lunch or dinner we go there."
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"Good experience, charming place with good food, some tapas were so-so, some were absolutely delicious. Amazing house wine"
Vinitus,I sat by myself outside and staff were so friendly they even turned the heater on for me. Food was good portion and tasty.
Vinitus,
Vinitus,Great tapas selection.  We tried several tapas with a glass of wine.  The staff was very attentive and knowledgable.
Vinitus,"Excellente adresse, cetait delicieux !"
Vinitus,I love the quality and service. I recommend it.
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,pretty delicious food Small potatoes at reasonable prices But tables very close together
Vinitus,
Vinitus,
Vinitus,Excellent tapas!
Vinitus,
Vinitus,"We go as usual and we have never had problems, but today we experienced a somewhat surreal situation. There is always a line to eat, today we signed up to sit on the terrace and we had several people in front of us (about 3/4 groups). The surprising thing is when a couple has arrived with a dog and has passed in front of all of us who were waiting. When discussing it with the manager, she told us that people with dogs had preference. It has been surprising, honestly. No one has made sense of that explanation. The truth is that we will consider returning, because lets see if we always find people with dogs passing by"
Vinitus,"Very delicious food, the shrimp and cuttlefish croquettes, the rice with lobster, the torrijas....."
Vinitus,"Excellent tapas, very nice and welcoming place, many tapas options, even very sophisticated ones. Excellent pulpo a la gallega. Unfortunately the place is always too crowded, too bad you cant book. Wheelchair accessibility: The place is on the ground floor"
Vinitus,"A great place with an interesting idea for dishes, all the snacks are here, you can try a little of everything, it s very cool Everything is incredibly delicious, fresh shrimp, delicious fish, Camembert with nuts Theres a big line on the street in the evening, its a wonderful establishment"
Vinitus,Excellente adresse ! Gracies para el momento
Vinitus,"En face de la Casa Ballto ce restaurant a tapas succulent ou on retrouve les tapas dantan. Certes a des prix moins abordables mais le rapport qualite prix y est. On a extremement bien mange. Mention speciale aux artichauts avec parmesan et truffe, un delice, ainsi que les artichauts frits. Les muntaditos sont excellents on a adore celle aux anchois thon poivrons et le saumon, avocat crevettes, extremement bien assaisonne un concentre de saveur. Les varietes de poissons frits et les batatas bravas etaient bons mais sans plus, je vous recommande de prendre autre chose tel que les couteaux ou les coquillages. Le gin etait tres bon et a prix interessant. On sest regale ! Ambiance interne au top."

Vinitus,"A great tapas experience, which we found upon recommendation of our hotel concierge. It didn t disappoint, having great food and a pleasant atmosphere. We sampled a variety of tapas, but their montadito escalivada with anchovy was my favorite."
Vinitus,One of the best Tapas in the city! Highly recomend and really worth waiting in a queue!
Vinitus,All really good and affordable
Vinitus,"A very good surprise! I will repeat for sure because everything is very good, the service is fast, with an open kitchen and the option to eat at the bar. Avoid peak hours because its small and they dont take reservations. I recommend the rice with llamantol, scrambled eggs, potato and Iberian ham, and the roasted chicken cannelloni."

Vinitus,"It was right below the accommodation. After going back and forth for a few days, I saw that there was a long waiting line every evening. I deliberately went a little earlier than dinner time, around 5:30 PM, and was able to be seated right away without waiting. The staff are all very friendly and the food comes out quickly once you order it. The food was generally delicious Ive eaten a variety of foods, so what would you recommend? I recommend honey cod, octopus dishes, and beef skewers. We went with three big eaters and one small eater, and it came out to about 160 euros. I would come again if I come back to Barcelona This is a delicious restaurant. I recommend it. Gracias! Dani & Reino"
Vinitus,"Its a steady seller at a Barcelona restaurant. I went there with doubts, but even though I went past 14:30 on a weekday, there was a 10-minute wait before I got in. I sat at the bar, but the kitchen was very lively, so the waiting time wasnt boring. I was touched by the friendly response even though they were extremely busy. I was sorry to discuss the menu, so I just showed the photos from the Google reviews. lol Clara, white wine is definitely delicious Honey cod, the delicious taste of honey fish you can imagine Flavored clams A clam flavor you can imagine Delicious well-grilled shrimp skewers Beef foie gras wasnt spicy and it was really delicious, wasnt it? I was curious about those fried red peppers, so I ordered them, but they tasted like grilled and salted peppers, so why were they delicious? I wanted to try making it in Korea. Eating this much costs  50.30 (satisfying). Anyway, it s a house worthy of its name~"
Vinitus,"I have been a Vinitus customer for a long time, I have always really liked the food, service and atmosphere; However, yesterday I had one of the worst experiences I have had in any restaurant, in any city in the world: a very nice and friendly waiter started serving us but there was a change of shift and thats when the man from the restaurant came in. photo. One of the most unfriendly, arrogant, disrespectful and poorly educated people who has ever treated me. Being such a good restaurant, its a shame that they lose customers by hiring people like that. If you want more details about what happened, you can contact me."

Vegan Junk Food Bar,"Brilliant. A different type of food. The waiter recommended the sweet potatoes fries, he explained to us that they were sweet potato fries, and they were very delicious. The decoration is different too, an alternative type of restaurant in the center. Kid-friendliness: They do accept children. There were several on the tables, I guess the colors of the hamburgers attract them :)"
Vegan Junk Food Bar,Highly recommended
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"It seems like the cooks have never had vegan food, and think we are supposed to give up our taste buds along with animal products. Sad, cause the ambience and concept is fun, and had positive expectations for this place. We went for dinner and had a quesadilla and ribs on chips. The quesadilla is actually an open soft taco, heavily loaded with sauces and so many other ingredients you can barely distinguish their flavours or finish the whole thing. The ribs tasted weird, like I would imagine if you sucked on some old wooden furniture. We did not finish this dish either, as it was too heavy and not appetizing. Both dishes tasted roughly the same, as they were slathered in the fake-cheese sauce whish destroyed any other flavour. We also ordered 2 cocktails which we returned, as they were sickly-sweet (and it was the least sweet pick of the list: pink gin and some fancy tonic). We settled for coconut water and rum (still kinda sweet, but tolerable. The coconut water, served in a fresh young coconut, is great). Service was ok, although none of our servers asked or seemed to care if anything was wrong with our dishes or drinks as they were being returned. So, yeah. Would not recommend."
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"The quality of their food is unbeatable, the textures of their dishes are very similar to non-vegan products. Everything has a spectacular flavor and color   The place is beautiful and has a free play area."

Vegan Junk Food Bar,"Its a restaurant Im going to for the third time, but this last time, unfortunately, it left a lot to be desired... First of all, the cook had to leave the kitchen to act as a waiter... since when does a boss allow that? Due to hygiene and the chefs rights, it should not... furthermore, neither the cook nor the waitress (the only employees) knew either Spanish or Catalan, and for my part there is no problem because we know English, but you have to empathize with all the customers and Im sure they will. Not only tourists access the premises, and we are in Barcelona Then the manager arrived, and since the starter had arrived a while ago but not the drinks, we asked about them. It turns out that he had just arrived and answered in an unpleasant and cocky way, so by not waiting for the answer we began to feel uncomfortable. When the drink arrived, the man continued to treat us rudely, until I decided to ask for the complaint form and he gave us trouble by leaving us a pen. In the end I got it and unfortunately the sheet goes to consumer offices... its a shame, but if they had known how to stop at the time and apologize this would not have gone to the end."
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"Great food, ambiance and service!"
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"I accompanied a vegetarian friend and loved it, both the juicy, very tasty burger and the side dishes. The atmosphere is wonderful, super out of place and stylish. The service is incredible, super friendly, polite and makes us feel at ease."

The shwarma was insanely delicious   even non-vegans would be impressed! The place itself is super cool, with funky and beautiful interior design that adds to the experience. Plus, the service was top-notch. Definitely a must-try, whether youre vegan or not."
Vegan Junk Food Bar,Good food with interesting choices. It took a long time to order and also to pay. It is a little bit more expensive Vegetarian options: Vegan food
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"We liked the site. Although they are not the best burgers we have tried, they have an original touch, the desserts are very delicious, yes, the potatoes were very expensive, at least they were good. Fast service because you order it from the app, and they bring everything quickly, but the staff is quite non-existent. I recommend going to visit the place, which is decorated very beautifully, and try the dishes at least once. Vegetarian options: The burgers are vegetables and so are the desserts."
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"Does Vegan Junk Food Bar ever disappoint?! We came on a quiet Saturday night and both of us had the melody of three mini burgers so we could each try the main burgers on the menu--if you cant choose between them, then I highly recommend this option! The sweet potato fries here are some of the best ever, and we opted for garlic mayo to get the ultimate combination. Staff are so lovely and welcoming and make the place even brighter. 10/10"

But the service was very average, there was only one waitress (although very nice) and it took them half an hour to serve us even though there were hardly any tables. It was very unpleasant and we were about to leave. Thank goodness the food made up for it but please dont neglect the crazy clientele that you just opened!!"
Vegan Junk Food Bar,"This place was really quiet when I arrived around 7.30 but thankfully, it got busier and the atmosphere improved whilst I was there. Each table has its own QR code to order food (you dont need to say which table youre at). Food was made and delivered quickly. I had anticipated fairly small portions but was pleasantly surprised by the size of each dish and in the case of the ceasar salad there was a really good amount of chicken and cheese. I also ordered the tropical cake jar which had an amazing flavour and light mousse texture. Excellent value, and a great vibe!"

The potatoes with a mini sauce that doesnt give anything, its quite bland (pink and purple sauce). Then some mini potato croquettes that have a very appetizing texture. The worst thing is the price, too high for the food served. It gives a feeling of low quality/price ratio."

Vegan Junk Food Bar,"-Mediocre food, if you are a local vegan you will know a thousand better places. They serve fast. -The pink bread was very pretty, but it was cold (and had a texture like chewing gum) and the quantity/quality/price ratio was not proportional. The peanuts in the dessert were (almost) rancid. -The atmosphere is good if you want to take a photo for Instagram and little else. -The attention, correct (more or less) but neither sympathy nor closeness. -Orders are made from the phone with a QR, without personal attention (what happens if I want another drink or if something about a dish is not clear to me?) - They only accept card payments. - I would not go back.

What they offer is not bad, but no longer in the top 3 nor the top 10. They have been falling behind in flavor. The burger bread was cold, the party was mushy, the chicken wings had a BBQ glace so sweet it almost felt like a dessert. They still have great interior design, style and presentation but the great quality of the food is no longer there."

I used to come here because they had tsukmen which is hard to find and it tasted authentic but the quality has gone down too far. As more and more ramen places open in Barcelona I hope people will encourage the restaurants more towards quality and not only  profitability. And if anyone reading this loves ramen, please visit Japan or get a Japanese persons opinion on what good ramen tastes like so we can all enjoy a higher standard here and not need to fly across world just to do it."

Koku Kitchen Ramen & Gyoza Bar,"Yesterday we went to eat a menu with my whole family and my children, ages 2 and 4, and they spent the whole night vomiting. Yesterday, when paying, I realized that they charged us 2.50e for water and that they had actually given us tap water and we were never warned. I realized when I listened to the girl at the next table that she was pregnant and told the waitress that she did not accept drinking water from the tap. The waitress confirmed that they didnt have bottled water  I drank beer so it didnt affect me. It is well known that the quality of Barcelonas water is not optimal for consumption and, at the very least, they should have warned us. I hope this goes away even with my children today, but if not we will have to consider filing a complaint with the health department."

Koku Kitchen Ramen & Gyoza Bar,"I was drawn to Koku Kitchen Ramen & Gyoza Bar because of the great reviews about their ramen, and I must say that the flavors and ingredients lived up to expectations. However, I felt that the temperature of the dishes could have been higher, and as a lover of spicy flavors, I would have wished they were a little more intense in that regard. We ordered Gin & Tonics, but unfortunately, our son accidentally knocked one over. The servers were incredibly friendly and replaced it quickly at no additional cost. Their service was exceptional, deserving a solid 10 in my opinion. We opted to sit on the ground floor, and I found the decor to be in perfect harmony with the style of the restaurant."

Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Yesterday I went to eat for the second time at Billy Brunch (the first time at the Poble Sec location, which is smaller) and I have to say that the first time was disappointing, but this time we ate very well and were very comfortable. We ordered an avocado toast (delicious), some eggs benedict (the presentation could be improved a little but they were delicious) and an acai bowl (this time it was well made, with fresh fruit, but Im missing the peanut butter, my downfall). The service was charming, they first offered us a small table but since we were with a stroller, they gave us a larger one, they moved us and we were much more comfortable. In the end they gave us a cup of the cute little chicken :) Thank you very much for everything, we will return!"

Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"My friend took me to this place for a quick breakfast before leaving Barcelona. We had to wait to be let in because its fully crowded but it was worth it. The acai and the avocado toast were amazing. The same goes for the ice latte. The prices were good and the service was excellent. The location was also good, just 5 minutes walk from my hotel. Ill try more of their menu next time Im there. They also have a nice backyard garden to chill too."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"The hot chocolate was cold.. The waiter took our order and didnt server for 40 minutes, when we ask how long it will take, we found out the he didnt tell the chef to make the food, he threw away the order paper by mistake .. And to make up for the mistake   they offered us free coffee.. drtd"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Very good option for brunch! The terrace is great. There is usually quite a queue and it is difficult to get a table.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"One of the best breakfast spots I ve ever visited. Great food, big portions, friendly staff. Found it by accident. Decided to try because it had a line of locals. Definitely recommend if you re nearby. The Club Sandwich was my favorite, but we went back several times and loved everything."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Very nice
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"We went with our dog. And everything was great, everything was delicious and they treated the dog great. Very friendly staff"

Billy Brunch Headquarters,Amazing brunch delicious pancakes and avo toast as well as acai bowl. Too bad we didn t eat in a garden because it is indeed idyllic.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Petit dejeuner au Billy Brunch, petit lieu tres tendance. Cetait bon dans lensemble malgre une petite erreur de commande qui nous a valu un surplus a laddition. Les oeufs Benedicte sont tres bons, mais les pancakes sont beaucoup trop epais et un peu sec & bourratifs... Le samedi a 11h, il y a beaucoup dattente donc nous avons passe notre tour. Le lendemain, a 10h aucune attente ! Privilegiez donc de ne pas y aller trop tard."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Uncomfortable place, complicated and expensive service, very expensive."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Perfect mushroom toast, acai bowl and great cappuccino!! You must visit it! Cosy place and polite team!! Eugenia is very sweet and kind!! Thank you!!"

Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Everything was amazing. The service was great and fast, and everyone there was really nice. The food was absolutely exceptional and the place had an amazing atmosphere. Loved this place and will definitely go back."

Billy Brunch Headquarters,Un super endroit pour prendre un brunch. Des plats de qualite.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,We waited a little bit to get in since its quite popular but it was totally worth it ! We loved everything about it!
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Best caramel latte I ve had in a while! Nice vibe and lovely staff
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Very wonderful and the food is special, especially the shakshuka"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,We had a lovely brunch here! We waited in a line for around 20 min and the staff brought us complimentary orange juice for waiting which was so nice! Food was worth the wait. I ordered the dulce de leche pancakes which were delicious. There was a perfect amount of dulce de leche between each pancake and the coconut added a nice touch. I also ordered orange juice which was delicious. My partner ordered the eggs benedict which he really enjoyed! Would definitely return :)
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Best experience IMPOSSIBLE!! From minute zero it was luxury. While we waited in line, they gave us an orange juice, which by the way we didnt wait more than 10 minutes to enter. The staff is wonderful, the food was deli and the service was next to EXCELLENT!! We were attended to by Lautaro and Francisco 1000/10!!! Thanks guys!! We enjoyed every detail of the place, they took care of everything from start to finish. We were fascinated by the decoration, everything is very well thought out! even the bill, they give it to you in a box of eggs We will definitely return!!"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Without a doubt the best brunch in Barcelona. We stood in line for only 15 minutes, very fast. The service is excellent and fast too, our waiter was Francisco and he served us wonderfully, with unmatched energy and a lot of good disposition. The food was excellent, the Eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked, and the avocado was very fresh. a 10 Dietary restrictions: They have vegetarian dishes, vegetable milks and gluten-free food."

We had a great breakfast here and I recommend going early or there will be a queue."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Amazing restaurant with a huge variety of food .. you would be so blessed if you were served by Francisco he is so friendly,  kind, and treats you with the best welcoming smile"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Nice little hole in the wall that expands into a multi-room restaurant specialized in brunches. Coffee products are excellent (and nicely decorated, see picture). Portions are large. Slightly disappointed by the pancakes however: they are supposed to be fluffy (quite thick), but they are undercooked in the middle (all 3 on a stack so it s not a fluke) and therefore a bit chewy. I can give a much better recipe to the cook if he needs :-) Besides that, a nice experience with excellent service, a solid 4*."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Besr breakfast in Barcelona. Youll have to wait 35-40 minutes, but you wont be disappointed"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Went today with six others.  Was  promptly greeted and taken to a table.  And our server Eugenia was absolutely delightful.  Her attention to detail (we were demanding with our options) and showed lots of patience with our group.  She was one of the best servers I have personally encountered in Barcelona and I live here.  Actually the entire staff was great.  Whoever owns Billy Brunch deserves a high five for the personnel.  Eugenia thanks for putting the apron together for my mom.  That was very thoughtful.  Will be back.  Thanks again.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Excellent, on s est bien regale"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Parfait pour un brunch. Valide a 100%
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Really very lovely. Food was amazing and the staff is friendly, I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good brunch!"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Cozy place. Super food. Thank you Marco for the efficient service and for your delicious coffee.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"The best cappuccino in Barcelona from Marco! The drawings he makes in the cafe are incredible, he is a genius!!!"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Excellent place to have breakfast or brunch. Excellent eggs benedict I was attended to by Eugenia, her smile and kindness made my experience even better."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,I came with a group of friends. Excellent food and service. I highly recommend the chocolate and strawberry pancakes. The waiter Francisco recommended several dishes and was very kind to us!! Well be coming back :)
Billy Brunch Headquarters,I had a great morning with my friends and we ate very well. We queued a bit to get in but they gave us orange juice while we waited for a DETAIL. I would definitely return
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Best breakfast place in Barcelona! Worth waiting in line to come in.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Great place. Food excelent its worth waiting in line Great stuff. Food : 5/5
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Overrated place. Very expensive for the quality of the food. Reheated old potatoes, scalded tomato and watery tortillas. The staff thinks they have a Michelin star. For Instagramers and tourists. Its not worth  30"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Absolutely love this place! An excellent addition to Barcelonas brunch scene. We visited two days in a row and tried the pancakes, acai bowl and scrambled eggs with spinach (came on a sourdough bread). I really enjoyed all of the dishes as well as the coffee and fresh orange juice. Nice latte art in the coffee as well, although the roast could be darker to my taste. The atmosphere is also very cozy and clean. Prices are very reasonable especially when the quality is so good! The service was amazing, our waitress was very considerate of my partners allergies. When I had the acai bowl I noticed a piece of strawberry with mold on it and told the waitress about it. They removed the molded strawberry and asked if I wanted a new one but I said no because I didnt want to waste a perfectly good dish. Then the waitress offered to remove the acai from our bill which turned an experience that couldve been negative into a positive one instead. Ill definitely be returning when I come back to Barcelona!"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"We really liked the place and the food was delicious. The staff is very attentive and kind. They gave my little one paints and paper as soon as he arrived. Eggs Benedict a pleasure accompanied with delicious potatoes. For the little one we asked for pancakes, and they offered us one instead of 3 (which was what was offered on the menu for 9 euros) because they were very large. We thought it was a good idea but then on the bill they charged us as a portion of 3. Thats why the 4 stars, we would have liked them to inform us of the price because we would have still opted for something else. But also, a highly recommended site."
Billy Brunch Headquarters,The best of the best
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"Very nice place! Pleasant staff, large portions, if you haven t finished eating they offer to take it with you, just what you need for breakfast! Kid-friendliness: I don t know about the menu, but they will offer a chair for a child. Wheelchair accessibility: A couple with children and a stroller came in when I was there, and the staff friendly offered to help!"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,This cute little place has such a warm and welcoming atmosphere that is very laid back. I had the Shakshuka and a mocha and they were both delicious. Vegetarian options: Had lots of listed vegetarian options Dietary restrictions: Had listed options for lactose intolerant and vegan diets. Kid-friendliness: Had a play area for kids and baby chairs.
Billy Brunch Headquarters,
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"As of the end of January, there was a group waiting in front of us and we waited for about 5-10 minutes to get in. It was delicious, the staff was really friendly, and the food was cute, so I felt really good! But now that I think about it, I should have waited a little longer and sat on the terrace."

Billy Brunch Headquarters,Perfect place! Pancakes are some of the most delicious Ive ever eaten! I recommend it
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Excellent brunch! The service and food were incredible but the best was the mocha that Laura made for me!!
Billy Brunch Headquarters,An exceptional brunch in Barcelona Special mention to Aina who delighted us with the avocado toast!
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"I really liked the place a lot! We were served by a very kind, attentive and helpful boy named Agustin, who recommended Eggs Benedict and Dulce de Leche Pancakes, which were exquisite!"
Billy Brunch Headquarters,The food was excellent (I recommend the dulce de leche pancakes to accompany the coffee) and the service was a 10. Agustin was super friendly and very attentive when it came to giving suggestions. I would return without a doubt!
Billy Brunch Headquarters,Food was delicious and the staff were so friendly! Especially our server Eugenia who recommended the Eggs Benedict!!!!
Billy Brunch Headquarters,An excellent breakfast and very tasty chai from barista Marco  ! Dietary restrictions: There is gluten-free bread and they ask you about allergies and intolerances
Billy Brunch Headquarters,"One of the best brunches Ive ever had, recommendation from my friend Benjy. The pancakes are delicious and the avocado toast too. The atmosphere and attention of ten, a place that you definitely have to stop by if you are in Barcelona."
Can Kenji,"Small place, a safe bet to eat any day, no matter how many years pass, the quality is always maintained. During the week they have menus with different prices. It is usually very crowded and difficult to find a place."
Can Kenji,"!Consegui el menu de sushi migdia y fue la comida perfecta!  Todo el pescado estaba muy fresco y sabroso, y la presentacion era hermosa.  El helado de te verde estaba delicioso y tenia un sabor a matcha muy rico.  Realmente una excelente relacion calidad-precio para una comida de tan alta calidad.  El servicio tambien fue muy rapido.  Definitivamente regresare :)"
Can Kenji,It s so delicious! !! I repeated my lunch. Im happy to be able to eat it for lunch on the evening menu (*^^*) Ill be drinking it from noon  (^o^) Awesome
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,Food was great looking and tasting! Small but nice restaurant also.
Can Kenji,The best Japanese food I have ever eaten in a very pleasant atmosphere!
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,This restaurant is highly recommended. The place is cozy and fills up quickly so it is advisable to reserve. Very attentive service and very good food. We tried the menu with Karaage and it was accompanied by miso soup and rice. For dessert they offered us several options and I chose azuki ice cream. I was left wanting to try more things so I will return.

Can Kenji,"Good menu del dia. Very loud in the evening. Walls are bare, no decoration, no acoustic treatments."
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,A small place with very good food and very good service. I cant be objective because my company was wonderful and I would have given 5 stars anywhere just to be with them.
Can Kenji,"As a good fan of oriental cuisine, I went to visit this restaurant and the truth is that I loved it, both the treatment of the staff (super attentive) and the product they served us (everything was exquisite). I was very surprised by the eel dish they had. The next time I return to Barcelona I will go to visit the Sato i Tanaka restaurant, where I will be able to meet and taste the dishes prepared by the chef live and direct, I am looking forward to meeting him. It is an experience that I will repeat again without a doubt."
Can Kenji,"Nice atmosphere, impeccable food and perfect service. Ill definitely be back ;)"
Can Kenji,"Its very difficult to find a good cost-effective Japanese restaurant in Barcelona, but Menu Del Dia is a good value for a weekday lunch. There are about 5 pieces of nigiri, and compared to the raw fish you eat in Korea, it feels a bit disappointing for the price, but the food served as primero is of good quality and filling. I recommend it as vegetable tempura and soy sauce braised chicken wings with primero!"
Can Kenji,Great quality-price ratio
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"Japanese restaurant where they prioritize the flavors over the atmosphere. Sober place, with few tables and exquisite food, where the flavor stands out. Japanese treatment and service, not intrusive but efficient and helpful. Without a doubt one of the best Japanese in Barcelona and at an affordable price for the great quality of the food."
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"Correct food, but very inattentive staff. Its gotten a lot worse in the last year. We were regular customers and we will not return again."
Can Kenji,We went to have the lunch menu and we really liked the quality of the product. First we ordered miso and then a variety of sushi. Highly recommended!!
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,Good quality sushi and very well prepared starters. Everything tasted amazing. Small place
Can Kenji,"A place to enjoy all its dishes, menu, sushi... 10 years frequenting the place and always excellent quality and service"
Can Kenji,"The best sushi Ive ever eaten, truly special!"
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"Very good, I had a lunch menu... a very delicious miso soup, a super tender and tasty karaage chicken accompanied with a bowl of rice and an excellent green tea ice cream. I will return to try the other menu options and a la carte dishes. I recommend it"
Can Kenji,"A hidden gem for sushi lovers in Barcelona. If you want a real, infused Japanese culinary experience focused solely on the food. This is your place. Variety of fresh fish cuts every day that include sea bass, turbot, lemon fish, scallops, salmon, tuna, bull, sea urchin, eel, squid, etc. No sauces, no mayonnaise, no fruit or flambeed. Susi, really and without nonsense. Personal, attentive and polite. Low capacity of diners, reservation is recommended. At lunch they have a menu that includes sushi or sashimi, which is also affordable and very interesting. One of my favorite dishes is tofu with monkfish liver. Its worth trying. It is truly spectacular."
Can Kenji,Everything was very good and very good service
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"Authentic Japanese restaurant! Very friendly service, great food, you have to make a reservation, its always full!"
Can Kenji,"We loved this place so much, the location itself is pretty basic decoration, tiny & cozy. I reccomend to seat by at the bar so you can see the chef prepare your food in front of you:) We had many different options and everything seemed pretty authentic and reasonable price. We spent 70  for two and we were full. This has become one of our favorite spots"

Can Kenji,"Cozy, hole-in-the-wall spot for sushi and izakaya plates. Amazing menu del dia - the sushi menu and salmon teriyaki are exceptional. Service is quick and efficient, quality is very consistent."
Can Kenji,There I always eat very well and the price is unbeatable. Japanese food
Can Kenji,"Authentic Japanese tavern The sashimi very well made and well proportioned A very good entrecote. The desserts are very well made, and the fresh ikura is very good Fast and very attentive service, thats all serious The place very good atmosphere"
Can Kenji,"Japanese restaurant with extensive menu. They do a lunch menu during the week. The place is small but cozy. We recommend booking, we went on Friday to eat and it was full. They have a bar where they also serve lunch/dinner, where reservations are not necessary. What stands out is that we tried the duck tataki (very good and the product was of great quality) and the sweet potato flan (we were surprised and liked it in equal measure). The attention of 10."
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"An excellent gastronomic bet. Top quality products, they serve quickly, they are friendly and everything is delicious. And on top of that, very well priced for Barcelona."
Can Kenji,I came here because I missed Japanese food. The taste is exactly Japanese and Im very satisfied. The meal was worth more than the price. thank you I would like to visit again
Can Kenji,"Very good sushi option in the center of Barcelona. Price-quality for the midday sushi menu is very high. Highly recommended, I will repeat for sure. The place is quite small and busy which hurts the service, but even that makes it even more similar to eating in Japan."
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,One of my favorite sushi in Barcelona
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,A marvel.
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"Quality Japanese food, which controls the gluten-free diet. It was a good discovery. At night they dont have a menu, only a menu. The place is small, so I recommend booking in advance. Parking: You need to be on time to park"

Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,"Good menu, good price and good service.... You must reserve."
Can Kenji,"Good place to eat good sushi and some other dishes. For lunch in a short time, not for a table setting or a romantic dinner. Tables together, without tablecloths, functional. Bar from which you see the preparation, if you are lucky enough to get a seat."
Can Kenji,
Can Kenji,I called ahead and asked if they allowed dogs in the restaurant and confirmed 3 times over the phone. When I arrived after a long trip they said my dog was  allowed to wait outside . Terrible communication and not dog friendly so I would never step foot there again.

The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Exclusive atmosphere with good food. The Wagyu burger was good, but not outstanding, but the price was okay. The best thing about this restaurant is the great ambience, and the service and food are also good. Can definitely be recommended."
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Their meat is delicious and cooked to the desired consistency. There are options for every budget. The wines are nice and the service is good. The only downside is that since the place is very small, there is a lot of noise. Tables are always together and very loud Vegetarian options: They serve steak for vegetarians. Parking: In a side street and in a place with no vehicle traffic"
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,Amazing food!!! Nothing more nothing less.
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Please dont get the slow roasted rib! It was a disappointment and didnt look like the other pictures on Google reviews! The mashed potatoes were on the side, little gravy ,I had to ask for more.  It was a disappointment on my last day in Barcelona."

The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,very bad experience
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,Shockingly horrible. Complete tourist trap. Avoid at all costs. I have no idea how there are other positive reviews out there - you absolutely do not want to waste your money on this place. Food : 1/5

The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"The food was delicious. We ordered nachos too, but after we finished our food, and we still didnt receive them, we asked to cancel and they said we cant. That was a little disappointing but we took it anyways. The waitress was very kind! The food was very tasty. We ordered 2 entrecote steaks. Both dishes came with chips and a heating plate. We also ordered nachos, they didnt arrive even after we finished the steaks and when we asked to cancel because it was supposed to be an appetizer, we were told that it was not possible because the order had already gone out. We didnt argue we just took them, but it was disappointing. The mozzarella was very nice :)"
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,Excellent restaurant. The managers service was 11 points. We had a spectacular night. We will be back
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"The best costumer service we have received. Hector was spectacular, very friendly and pleasant. The meat was at its best, and I recommend that you order the Creole chorizo, one of the best I have ever tasted. If you are visiting Barcelona, be sure to visit the place."
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Tbh I was excited to come and taste the food. But the minute I arrived and saw this sticker on the door, I felt like they banned me from the resturant. They lost a costumer. And I believe I wont be the only one."
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,We ate the fillet and the picana... everything was fabulous!!! Accompanied by red wine and dessert!!! Advised
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Bonsoir, Tout etait parfaitement parfait. Tous les plats etaient absolument maitrises.

Souriant et a lecoute. Merci a tous"
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Excellent steak house, excellent meat, wine, friendly and helpful staff.. For meat lovers...highly recommended"
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"It s almost like Dottegi Market. There are so many people and the staff are busy and the bar is full of dishes left on the tables that have been cleaned up after eating. Ordering and food service are slow. There are some Korean tourists, but most of them are locals. Since there are so many places in Barcelona that serve Argentinian steak, I think there are plenty of places to go even if its not here. The food is nothing more or less than steak, so I wouldnt say its a must-visit restaurant. Its close to the cathedral, so its easily accessible and worth a visit if its not busy."
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Really good food and especially meat. The service was also nice. Its a bit too crowded place with a not so good smell since the kitchen is open and connected with the dining area. All in all, I totally recommend it!"
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Un bon accueil de lequipe tres souriante, une bonne cuisine agreable, fraiche et viandes ou poissons grilles sur place au charbon de bois. Une bonne adresse a Barcelone."

The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,Very good octupus
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"The location of this restaurant is great and the inside is well decorated and looks nice. The food was a little expensive but most places in this area are expensive. We got the entrecote steak which came with fries. The steak was cooked just how we asked which was nice. It came pre-cut into slices with nothing on it but some salt and chilli flakes on the side which you can put on yourself. It was really nice, a bit small but tasted great. We were served really quickly and looked after. The toilets were clean and had soap and a hand dryer."
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"Delicious food. Due to the crowds, it is wise to make a reservation! Price is great!"
The Steak house - Grill Restaurant,"A few days ago we saw this restaurant, and today we specifically visited it.  We did not regret it, the food was very tasty and nicely served.  The service was friendly and we were served relatively quickly."

Gabby's Brunch,"Very delicious food, very well served dishes."
Gabby's Brunch,"Place that has fallen into disrepair lately. There is no longer as much demand as at the beginning. The Huevos Rancheros disappointed me a little. The guacamole was somewhat tasteless, lacking flavor and some strength. Very weak lemonade. The best is the coffee and the good slice of carrot cake, although a bit dry. The service could be improved. tourist site"
Gabby's Brunch,"Great place to eat! Me and my partner stumbled across this place on our first day in Barcelona and it was great. Best food we ve eaten the entire trip, and the waiter was really polite and lovely! 10/10 would recommend"

Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,"The friendly and attentive waitress. A man, I dont know if he was a manager or something similar, a disaster, the hospitality industry is too big for him. It lacks tact and many tables. Natural shakes have nothing in them."
Gabby's Brunch,"I went to have breakfast and 40 minutes after bringing me coffee I left without having breakfast because they had not written down my order. And on top of that they charge me for coffee. Look, I liked breakfast the other day, but it was very poorly resolved. I havent had breakfast, Im not going to eat today because I travel from 1-4pm and its eleven. Fatal."
Gabby's Brunch,"Fantastic breakfast food and restaurant. Our server was also a delight. Only reason this restaurant doesnt get a 5 star is for prices/value. The food is amazing, but on the more expensive side for the food it is."
Gabby's Brunch,"Excellent place to enjoy a good brunch, very good service"
Gabby's Brunch,"The food is abundant, the coffee very good. I recommend it for brunch. The waiters are very friendly! An Excel service without a doubt I recommend it"
Gabby's Brunch,"we will never go back again. We had a breakfast here, and everything was fine, the girl who served us was very nice and we would have given a 5 stars rate, but the tall man (maybe the manager) wasn t nice with us, never smiled, and seemed like to be always angry, that s the black point that made our stay bad, my friends wife was pregnant and she felt very bad about the way he treated us, we will never go back again."
Gabby's Brunch,"I had a disappointing experience at this brunch spot. While our waiter was pleasant, the guy who seated us was consistently rude and unwelcoming throughout our visit, even interrupting our waiter mid-order to attend to another task. This behavior was unlike anything Ive encountered elsewhere. Although I enjoyed the flavor of the kimchi Belgian waffle, it was evident that the waffle itself wasnt freshly made. The interior decor is dull and uninspiring and the ambiance has a distinctly touristy vibe. Overall, I cannot recommend this place and wont be returning."
Gabby's Brunch,"Excellent service and unbeatable food, very good desserts too. I recommend the place 100%"
Gabby's Brunch,"Great service and great food, wait time was less than expected!"
Gabby's Brunch,"Eggs Benedict 10/10! We came to Barcelona in 2022 for  Primivera Sound and had breakfast in here on our last day, it was so good that 2 years later Im back for my Birthday so I looked it up. They still have super friendly Staff, loads of great brunch options and..Bottomless Mimosa! Ill definitely be back again!"
Gabby's Brunch,The BEST brunch place in Barcelona. All dishes amazing and the brownie  that s another level! 100% recommend.
Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,Everything perfect. Very good coffee and lots of things to choose from if you like. Larger interior than it looks from the outside and two terraces to enjoy what you drink. Good attention and kindness.

Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,The eggs benedict didnt have much flavor and arrived rather cold and also a long time after the coffee. The staff is friendly. The prices are expensive in relation. Everything sweet looked good.
Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,Be prepared for a horrible service. Don t believe in the hype based on the reviews or influencers. These guys are unapologetic and have little care for customers after making us wait for 45 min to be seated and another 25 min to take the order. The perception that are the most sort after brunch place in Poblenou is just a perception and far from reality. For the average food they serve the wait is definitely not worth it. If you have all the time in the world and want spend the entire weekend waiting for them to serve you a plate of eggs. You can put this place on your wishlist. I wouldn t not recommend going to this place going away with bad feelings.
Gabby's Brunch,"The food and the coffee were really nice but they have me waiting for more than more than an hour. They are quite disorganized. As a constructive critic, it would be nice at least to be asked for the coffee or drinks first and then the food if they are that busy. Had to say that the service were kind and nice in every moment, just really slow."
Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,Great food and an even better atmosphere.
Gabby's Brunch,"Good service, saw Kevin de bruyne in the place so that was cool"
Gabby's Brunch,"Above all, I didnt like the service, very disorganized and slow, the first time I got tired of waiting and left, since there was only one I went ahead of me, and the second time when I was about to leave for the same reason, the waiter returned to ask me again what I had asked that he had forgotten what he had asked for. The prices were quite expensive, and the coffee did not stand out."
Gabby's Brunch,Very cozy and everything we ordered was delicious. Gladly again
Gabby's Brunch,Ame. Theres a reason its always full. Speechless. You have to go and try everything. The kids are sweet and the terrace is beautiful. Thank you!
Gabby's Brunch,"First time at Gabbys and the food we ordered was delicious! One point to highlight is that it is pet friendly, we were able to take our dog and they treated him wonderfully; They gave him water, sweets and lots of love. A point to improve would be the attention at the beginning, it took a while to take our order. Otherwise everything is excellent"
Gabby's Brunch,"Very nice place, fast service and courteous and helpful staff, fantastic desserts, good orange juice, top cappuccino, amazing Crisby bacon Our brunch these days on holiday in Barcelona. Luca from Gatteo Mare Italy"

Gabby's Brunch,
Gabby's Brunch,"Gabbys Brunch offers a delightful experience. Although we had to wait a little, once a table was available, we were quickly seated in the interior patio, ideal to enjoy on mild days. We tried the Norwegian toast and the Turkish eggs, accompanied by coffee and juices, all excellent! The waiters attention was exceptional; Their friendly treatment will undoubtedly make us return."

Elisabets Restaurant,Belle decouverte parmi les nombreux restaurants du centre. Tapas genereuse et delicieuse. Tres bon rapport qualite prix a deux pas de la boqueria. A ne pas manquer.
Elisabets Restaurant,"February 22, just after 12:00 noon, I ask the waitress at the bar, when she has deigned to pay attention to me...she has been talking to other customers for almost 5 minutes and she had already seen me, a jerk and I tell him that I will have it at a table of two that was empty. She charges me and I go to the table to take it calmly, shortly after another customer comes in to ask if she could eat something, when I say she didnt have a reservation she says well I guess youll eat in less than half an hour seeing that he was a foreigner, she immediately leaves. He approaches my table and orders me with bad manners: I need this table, leaving us both with a poker face and orders you can go to that other one in a corner and reserved for eating. In short, I will not return again, terrible treatment of customers. To make matters worse, the poor client did not understand anything and even apologized to me. Surreal situation and sorrowful manners. I wont come back."
Elisabets Restaurant,Excellent restaurant with an unforgettable ambience. Family atmosphere and varied lunch menu. You never forget these dishes! 100% recommendation
Elisabets Restaurant,Searching the streets we found ourselves in the shop.  the daily stay is only  15.  The nemu  included salad main course and dessert.  I was pleased.  The environment was comfortable. I recommend.

Elisabets Restaurant,"Quality and very welcoming place in the center of Barcelona. Delicious food, with products from their own garden. We thought the coffee was spectacular!"
Elisabets Restaurant,I entered place for a sandwich but a lady tried to inform us without asking nothing that if we dont have reservation we should leave. And there were at least 4 empty tables and we were there just for a sandwich. Even we could take sandwich as a take out. I found it rude.

Elisabets Restaurant,Es un restaurante pequeno al que merece mucho la pena ir a comer. Los ingredientes con los que trabajan son de primera calidad y eso se nota al probarlos. Los duenos son un encanto y el servicio esta a la altura. Ademas mantienen los precios del menu muy asequibles para la oferta que hay en sitios tan centricos como este. Recomendadisimo!!
Elisabets Restaurant,
Elisabets Restaurant,"Continue with the same charm as always. The sandwich flutes,,,you wouldnt stop eating."
Elisabets Restaurant,"Very chaotic and the hallway is very narrow, the service is quite unfriendly to non-Spanish speakers, when I said I don t speak Spanish ( no hablo espanol  ) and the lady kept talking to me in Spanish, which can be considered rude. And there were free tables inside but she said it s already full. I hope that s not out of racism or something, but I don t feel comfortable staying in the restaurant when I don t understand what she was talking about. I don t know about the food, but the service is very terrible I would never recommend any of my English speaking friends go there again."

Elisabets Restaurant,What can I say! Unbeatable service-quality.

Elisabets Restaurant,"Small restaurant surrounded by centuries-old and monumental buildings of culture and art, homemade dishes of lifelong quality but with a personal touch, a daily menu with an unbeatable price"

Elisabets allows you to enjoy the proximity of Barcelonas epicenter with a good offer and dishes that are worth trying.

Spectacular quality in the food (vegetables from the garden worked by Pere, one of the brothers who runs the bar, and which he brings there daily). Exquisite service. Prices contained. Fantastic decoration. All the staff are wonderful. I could repeat it daily. Many thanks to all the staff for always treating us so well."

Elisabets Restaurant,"It was great last time I came here, but right now its closed until 28th August. Ill come back next time!"
Elisabets Restaurant,"It was so good here that I ate here twice in my 2 day visit in Barcelona. To me its like homecooking. The waitress was very attentive, friendly and smiley. Without asking she gave me an extra lemon for my squid when she saw me squeezing out the last drops of my original one. The prices are not inflated like the other restaurants in the area. The vibe is casual but friendly. The location hidden but accessible. The locals hang here. It really is a hidden gem. The interior is warm and inviting, vintage style which I love. Their menu is only in Spanish with no pictures and the waitresses do not speak English which poses a problem to foreigners but it is an authentic experience. So on my second visit I prepared myself with pictures that I screenshot from the reviews of others and pointed to them to the waitress. So much easier. My first meal was the lunch menu. Reasonable at 14 euros something with entree, main and dessert. The salad was fresh with an amazing dressing. The stew was melt in your mouth. The dessert tasted delicious and not too sweet. On my second visit, for a brunch, I tried the tapas. I ordered the fried squid (soft and bouncy) and the potato tortilla served with slices of bread slathered with the juice of the tomato and sprinkled with just enough salt to enhance the flavour. I particularly loved the tortilla. Goodness I was in heaven. It was perfecto! Fluffy and you could taste the earthy potatoes. The expresso was also nice and strong not watery which some places do. Highly recommened to all! I would give more stars if I could. Must visit before leaving Barcelona."
Elisabets Restaurant,"Perfect for going out for drinks and tapas, the waitresses are very nice and the tapas are very good, I will return another day"

Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,Amazing place full stop
Tosca del Carme,"Super place. Everything is very tasty, both seafood and meat dishes. On top of all this, it s also inexpensive. Each dish for two, to fill up you need 3-4 dishes, depending on the calories spent per day)) We didn t try desserts, there was no room for them anymore) Meat with potatoes and honey sauce, salmon, mussels - super! Weve been to different restaurants, but after that we only ate here! Beer and womens drinks are delicious too! Alle Gerichte sind sehr lecker! Noch ein Vorteil ist, dass es im Vergleich zu anderen nicht teuer ist Dieses Restaurant war die perfekte Erganzung zum atemberaubende Barcelona!"

Tosca del Carme,"The food is excellent... The quality/price ratio too The only thing to comment on was the very loud music, the place was full (with the noise caused by the customers), it made the visit not very comfortable. We will try another day during the week to compare recommendable Vegetarian options: EXCELLENT mini vegetarian burgers!!"

Tosca del Carme,Will be back
Tosca del Carme,"Excellent tapas restaurants. Not a bad choice, fair price. Small quiet terrace also. 2nd time we go there and really not disappointed."
Tosca del Carme,"We spent a week in Barcelona and I can honestly say this was the WORST dining experience by far! Service was deplorable! The   waitress was rude and awful! Burnt calamari, shrimp with sand inside, stale bread .fatty steak, and I m not saying all I should.  Avoid this place especially if you re American, they will treat you bad! Spend your money elsewhere, these people are definitely racists!"
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"Incredible!!! Being tapas we thought they could be small but on the contrary, they come in a good quantity and are delicious in flavour; The staffs attention was also incredible and the cocktails are delicious and all at an affordable price."

Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"Cute, cozy place with nice food"
Tosca del Carme,"Nice vibe. I ordered two dishes only for 18 Euros! I like the juiciness of the steak, which was served with refreshing mustard and mushroom sauce. I came alone and couldnt finish the fried squid. They were so kind as to offer me a doggy bag."
Tosca del Carme,The bravas are at a higher level than the rest of the bars. It has an outside terrace where the sun shines until midday.
Tosca del Carme,"Ate here this afternoon, vegetarian mini lasagna, shrimp and toast with brie. All three dishes were very tasty, shrimps were well marinated, marmalade with the brie was perfect and the lasagna had a good flavor. Nice place to sit with friendly staff."
Tosca del Carme,"I ordered 4 plates, and unfortunately only one was good The first plate was lasagna, it was dried and microwaved in a bad quality. The second one was shrimps, it was OK The third one was Empanada, that one was good The fourth was chicken, and it was really really bad. Also the coffee was horrible The staff kept us a long time to get the bill It wasnt a pleasant experience overall"
Tosca del Carme,"Very tasty tapas for every taste, from vegetarian to meat to seafood. Super nice staff. Prices also top cocktails under 10 . Gladly again"
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"The staff are very friendly and they also speak English for those who doesn t understand Spanish. Nice jar of Sangria, platters and bravas. Loved the place and service. Food"
Tosca del Carme,"Really good tapas and value and especially the service, all the staff have brilliant English too and went above and beyond to ensure a good meal and atmosphere"
Tosca del Carme,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel front desk staff right after arriving at the hotel after a 14-hour flight. I was planning to visit Tosca once when I came to Barcelona, and I dont know if its a branch here, but there was a place called Tosca del Carme. It was difficult to evaluate the taste of the food because it was a long flight and there was a time difference, but the staff was very friendly and the food was good. I thought it would be a little bit because it was tapas, but there was a lot of food so I had some left over. The tuna tataki was the best, and the pork loin pincho was a bit tough and had a strong meaty flavor."
Tosca del Carme,Nice place to have a drink and a bite to eat.
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,Excessive delay in serving you. Somewhat cold food.
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"If you like the philosophy of tapas, drop by"
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"Terrible service! We went to dinner at midnight after a concert, and they gave us a 70x70cm table for four people. Before serving us dinner based on several different tapas dishes, We asked them if we could add a table that had been left free next to us so we could put the dishes, with three quarters of an hour left before closing they refused to add the table to us with the excuse that they had to clean it and put it away. The food was just fine, but we had to gobble down the dishes to leave room for the next ones to be brought to us. They cleared our table and without offering us dessert or coffee, at a quarter to one they brought the bill to the table without asking for it. Obviously the pot has been zero. Respecting the closing time, if you cannot serve customers well, it is better not to receive them. We will not return."
Tosca del Carme,Nice little place.  Everything we had was delish.  Would highly recommend.
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"We ordered a portion and it took a long time, poor organization and there were 3 waiters. The portions are not out of this world either."
Tosca del Carme,"Very nice place, good cuisine, there is a lunch menu for 15 euros, which includes 2 courses, dessert and a glass of wine!"
Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,All perfect !!
Tosca del Carme,"I was recommended the restaurant by friends and it was amazing! Their chicken rolls were nice, although maybe a bit soggy, the fish was one of the best I ve ever eaten and the dolce de leche ice cream was to die for! The team at tosca del carme was very helpful and spoke perfect english AND french!"
Tosca del Carme,"Nice place, good service, tapas food"
Tosca del Carme,Food was excellent! I can only recommend. I am used to Paris prices and this is a bargain. 2 people can eat dinner and drink cocktails here for under 50  no problem at all. I add photo of my Negroni

Tosca del Carme,
Tosca del Carme,"To eat something quick and not expensive is fine. but it is a place of preheated dishes, and very salty."
Tosca del Carme,"Amazing experience, best food we had while visiting Barcelona."

Cremat 11,
Cremat 11,"The pancakes are insane - possibly the best ones Ive ever had anywhere in the world, a true must-try! Coffee is great as well and the service is friendly. Its quite a small space so during busy brunch times it might be hard to get a table and theres a long queue."
Cremat 11,
Cremat 11,distinct
Cremat 11,"The steak and eggs are to die for. Delicious. kudos to the chef. The raspberry lemonade is homemade and yummy, I added sugar syrup because I like it more sweet but it comes with its natural flavor first. Our waitress Vanissa was attentive, fast, and very welcoming. She served us all the time with a smile!"
Cremat 11,"I recently had brunch at this amazing restaurant and it was fantastic! From the warm welcome by Vanessa, the manager, to the attentive staff checking on us, the experience was lovely! The pancakes and eggs benedict were delicious, with light, fluffy pancakes and a perfect balance of chocolate and fresh fruit. I highly recommend this place for a wonderful brunch experience!"

Cremat 11,"Great place, English friendly, gluten free options would recommend the Eggs Royal"
Cremat 11,"We found this charming establishment by chance. Located in the heart of a quiet and welcoming square, it offers both an outdoor terrace and an indoor space. A special mention deserves the innovative  nutellino , a version of cappuccino with Nutella, which together with the salty and sweet pancakes with fruit and homemade caramel, become the protagonists of a memorable gastronomic experience."
Cremat 11,
Cremat 11,"Friendly service, pleasant square and spectacular brunch!"

The standout feature was the exceptional quality of the food   fresh ingredients, creatively prepared, and bursting with flavor. A highlight was the Pancake Benedict, which was simply unforgettable. What really set this lunch apart was the outstanding service. The staff was friendly, attentive, and offered great recommendations. Their professionalism added a special touch to our experience. In short, Cremat 11 offers a fantastic lunch experience where delicious food meets excellent service. Can t wait to return!"
Cremat 11,Great food and amazing staff. Best place to brunch in Barcelona Vegetarian options: Vegan friendly Dietary restrictions: They have gluten free and lactose free options

A 10 for the service, thanks to Amalia for advising us well and delighting us with her fantastic Italian! When we return to Barcelona we will definitely repeat!"
Cremat 11,"Possibly the best individual meal I had in Barcelona - the eggs benedict was amazing. Really lovely ambience, great service and Ive already covered the food!"
Cremat 11,"This place was incredible, the food was amazing and we were so impressed by how efficiently all of the staff were working. Alin made magical coffee and cocktail drinks in the bar area while Vanessa attended to everyone without missing a beat. Shout out to the kitchen as well, the avocado toast was bomb."
Cremat 11,"This is a good find for weekend brunch! Seems to be in demand, but we were lucky didn t have to wait too long for a table. Seating outside is great, out on a quiet square. Everything that we tried was excellent - coffee, juice, eggs burger. It caters to all the cravings from salty to sweet. Service was excellent too - fast and friendly."

Cremat 11,delicious
Cremat 11,"Delicious, delicious and excellent staff! Vegetarian options: All dishes are adaptable"
Cremat 11,Cute spot for brunch. The outdoor seating area was completely full but I was able to get a table indoors. It is a small restaurant but nice and cozy. The service was great. They moved me to a smaller table in order to fit other customers so they compd my latte. I appreciate this nice gesture. The eggs benny was good but not the best.
Cremat 11,Had a lovely brunch with my friends! The place is very small so you might end up waiting for a bit to get a table but it was definitely worth it!
Cremat 11,"I would also give 12 stars!!!!!! Simply great food, great service and the prices are also very good   the location looks great   we will definitely come back!!!!"
Cremat 11,Great service and food.  First place I have found a pancake Benedict and it s GOOD. Loved the atmosphere.
Cremat 11,"The best brunch in Barcelona! Located in Born, it has the best pancakes and the portions are well served. The service is wonderful!"
Cremat 11,Best brunch in Barcelona!!! The pancakes are PHENOMENAL
Cremat 11,"A normal place, there are some interesting items on the menu and a cocktail menu (but when we visited, the  diva menu  was not available) I can t say that the place was captivating. You can visit once)"
Boa-Bao,"I love this site! Last week I organized my birthday dinner and we were a group of ten people. Delicious food, fast and efficient service and very beautiful decoration. I loved it, it was not the first time I went and of course it will not be the last. Highly recommended. They have a very original cocktail menu :)"
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Good place for a group of friends dinner as well as a dinner for 2. Very good dishes (the sauces from the boa bao delight assortment are the best). With a starter + individual plate or a bao (I recommend the classic or the dragon bao) + individual plate, I think it is more than enough for two people. The waiters are very friendly without invading the space too much. The only drawback I would say is that the music is so loud that sometimes you couldnt hear what your companion was saying."
Boa-Bao,"The restaurant is really cute inside with a drink menu inside a passport. The staff are really friendly and fun to talk to. The salt and pepper calamari had an interesting sauce and can be a little salty for some. The peking duck bao was good but was missing the crunchy skin I would associate with peking duck. The Tom Yam Kung had a good amount of large shrimp and portion of noodles. I enjoyed the broth as well. If youre looking for Asian fusion with a nice ambience, this is a good spot to check out."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Everything was amazing from start to finish . The food  and cocktails were delicious . The nicest place we have eaten in while staying in Barcelona , would highly recommend. Food"
Boa-Bao,Very charismatic and peculiar place. Very friendly staff and very good food. Very reasonable price quality. Surely if we return to BCN we will repeat.
Boa-Bao,"I had dinner tonight with my partner at this place and we loved it. First we ordered the dim sum assortment and although they seemed small in size, the flavor was spectacular. We had never tried such delicious dim sum. We tried the sea bass bao, the chicken bao, and the pork belly bao, and all three were delicious, especially the chicken bao, which reminded us of Tom Yum in flavor. We have also eaten the bulgogi salmon, very good. We wouldnt repeat the karipap although it wasnt bad, it was 4 small empanadas. We didnt order dessert and I ordered a mango mocktail which I really liked. We would definitely repeat since the service has been excellent from all the waiters who have served us. The place is very nice and the price is about  40 per person."
Boa-Bao,"The place is beautiful but the service is unbeatable, the waitress Alina served us and recommended great things with her beautiful smile, without a doubt to repeat"
Boa-Bao,"Really great food, had a starter and bao buns and special and very tasty cocktails. Service was unobtrusive but always there and very nice."
Boa-Bao,Very tasty food and wonderful service :)
Boa-Bao,"Very tasty and high quality food, excellent service, beautiful place, the cocktails are out of this world!!!"
Boa-Bao,great food and drinks and fun atmosphere with friends will definitely be back!
Boa-Bao,Jebb is the coolest guy ever. Food gas too.
Boa-Bao,Food was amazing and our server Jebb was the best!

Boa-Bao,"This place has very tasty bao! Also stylish interior and courteous service. I would also like to mention the design of the menu, very interesting."
Boa-Bao,"Cute little restaurant, Best Asian fusion in Barcelona"
Boa-Bao,"Saw this spot while walking at night... Little hip spot of Fusion-Asian food... Give it a shot and OMG! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and the start of the night... THE FOOD! everything we tried was cooked to perfection! Even the ginger lemonade was perfectly made! From now on every time we come to Barcelona well surely come back to Boa-Bao!"
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,This food was so delicious we ordered Tom yam what was my favorite but also the buns and curry s were amazing. One of the rare restaurants that had plenty of vegetarian options. The waiters were also very helpful and kind.
Boa-Bao,"Where I m from there is really good Asian food, and Boa Bao was decent. I appreciate the variety of Asian cuisines available (Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai etc). Even though the dishes I tried had the essence of the respective cuisine, they lacked the full flavor profile of their more authentic counterparts. The restaurant is beautiful, the service is great and it has a really cool vibe."
Boa-Bao,"Pad Thai and green curry incredible, also the Peking duck rolls and the eggplant garnish...the waiter very friendly, we will return!"
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Good Asian restaurant in the heart of Barcelona. The site takes care of every detail to add authenticity. We ordered the Vietnamese roll (normal, a little dry), the baos, which is undoubtedly the star dish and you cant leave without ordering them (especially the sea bass, its incredible  ). Finally, the pad thai surprised us a lot, perhaps the best dish in the restaurant. If you dont order dessert you dont miss anything. The price in the photo is deceptive, they miscalculated      We finally paid  45 per person, a correct price for everything we ordered. Good restaurant, recommended to go!"
Boa-Bao,Great service and amazing vegan options. We loved the cocktails too.
Boa-Bao,A good Asian food restaurant. Very nice and friendly service. Good choice.
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Correct service. The curries are not bad, I have tried better. The infusions are original and good."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,Delicious and very good service. Jebb was an amazing host which made me leave with a smile.
Boa-Bao,My man Jebb is a great guy and even gave us a free round of drinks after some miscommunications!
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,We always go for the cocktails and everything is very good. The service is always attentive to anything
Boa-Bao,"Very good service, good food, my only drawback is that the hot sauce   is salty, both the second in the kitchen Javier Gutierrez and the waiter who served me was friendly. The chocolate rolls are delicious and now they have become a vice for me. Thank you for such a pleasant experience. I will recommend you all"
Boa-Bao,"Very small portions, but the food was good."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"The place has a great atmosphere, the food is delicious. Those who serve are nice. I only have 2 things to note: the tables for 2 are very close together, it seems like you are eating with other people and they put everything super fast and are very precise so that you order. I mean, we ordered some cocktails and they served them to us in no time and after 3 minutes they brought us the food. They didnt give us time to taste the drinks."
Boa-Bao,"A wonderful evening, Cedrick attended us, everything he recommended to us was excellent, very dedicated attention, we will repeat for sure. Hernan and veronica"
Boa-Bao,So good. Forgot to take photo. Coco curry and seabass is highly recommended. Definitely go again.
Boa-Bao,"I love this place! It has such a large selection of Asian dishes from different regions. We tried the pad Thai, the beef pho and the bao buns and wow they re all soo good! I definitely recommend the pho and the sea bass buns were the most decadent yet flavorful ones I ve ever had. They were so good we went to eat them twice in one day!! Highly recommend this place"
Boa-Bao,"This place is absolutely amazing. By far the best restaurant in Barcelona to eat a mix of Asian delicacies. Food was over the top, service from Jebb and Jan were truly amazing, had answers to everything. I would recommend this place to anyone. Will definitely come again!!!!!!!!!!"
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"It looks beautiful, but the food is not classic asian. I came for tom um and it was with noodles inside and too diluted. We also ordered bao, they were not bad, but they were uncomfortable to eat by hand. drinks are good. In general, the place is a little expensive for its quality."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,Great food and top waiters. What more could you want? The flavors are very authentic and the menu is a medley of South East Asia. Very cool atmosphere too. We will be back.
Boa-Bao,pleasant service and good quality of food.
Boa-Bao,"It is a modern place with good decoration. The bad thing is that they play the music very loud. The food is not bad, there are several options to choose from, it also has vegan and vegetarian options. However, there are better Asians. The portions are too small for the high prices they have. The customer service is not bad, the staff is friendly, however, they were delayed in service and brought things that were not ordered. The staff (not all of them because there was a fairly efficient waiter) lacks agility, being more helpful, being more attentive and available to the customer. Vegetarian options: Has vegan and vegetarian options"
Boa-Bao,"Restaurant accueillant avec une bonne cuisine. Mention special au serveur Arnold pour son service, et ses conseils. Je recommande !"

Boa-Bao,"If you like Asian food, I have no complaints about it. Our complaint is with the service, unprofessional, poorly coordinated, dishes arrived that were for other tables. And the most annoying thing is the time of use of the table, this is a new trend in restaurants. In an hour and a half you have to leave the table. I can understand it every day at noon in a restaurant with menus for workers, not on a Friday night in an a la carte restaurant, with desserts and cocktails. More than a restaurant, it looks like an assembly line / fast food"
Boa-Bao,Very good atmosphere and excellent lovmcal. Jebb and Cedrick excellent hosts. Thanks for everything

Boa-Bao,"I was having dinner with my girlfriend two days ago. Its not bad, but the baos (their star dish and which gives them their name) are nothing out of this world either. They dont have the spherical and closed shape that traditional baos have, since here they are served in taco mode   but for a chain, they arent bad at all either. The service is correct and the atmosphere is very friendly, something normal in a city like Barcelona."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Great restaurant with nice food, great atmosphere and friendly helpful staff. Big thanks to Alex at the bar - a great guy! Vegetarian options: Lots available"
Boa-Bao,"Very good food, good atmosphere, very fast when serving and impressive broths."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"The place was very cool, the food was good although the dish I chose lacked a little flavor but the service was great, we were served by Oumaima, a super nice waitress who treated us super well, excellent:)"
Boa-Bao,Great atmosphere and service! Very good food too. Price a bit inflated for my taste.
Boa-Bao,Excellent. Highly recommended.
Boa-Bao,I also went to Barcelona and Lisbon to eat at this restaurant and we loved it. The food is spectacular and the service fast and good.
Boa-Bao,"Jebb treated us great, explained everything to us and gave us very good recommendations!"
Boa-Bao,"Fantastic service, delicious food, nice atmosphere. We had a great time."
Boa-Bao,Cool place with Asian food from different countries. Ideal if you are a Baos fan.
Boa-Bao,100% recommendable. Meal of 10
Boa-Bao,"Very fun, lively atmosphere with good music! We had Carmen as our server and she was great. Welcomed us in kindly and took care of us!"
Boa-Bao,Great food and Carmen was a wonderful server!!
Boa-Bao,"GOOD ASIAN FOOD AND HIGH PRICE - DONT FORGET TO BOOK FOOD: Almost everything is tasty, especially baos and curries. SERVICE: Fast and friendly. LOCAL: It is nice, it has two floors and the lower one is open to the kitchen, so it is much noisier than the upper floor. PRICE:  40-45 per person. CHILDREN: they have high chairs. THE BEST: the Sea Bass Bao. THE WORST: the wan to and the desserts. Kid-friendliness: They have a high chair."
Boa-Bao,"It was excellent service, the food was very delicious and everything was to taste."
Boa-Bao,The service was excellent and they took great care of us and the food was excellent!!
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Local with very careful decoration and perfect lighting. The food was great and the cold tea I had, TOP."
Boa-Bao,Very tasty Asian food. Very well attended in a very nice place. (The wine was a little expensive)
Boa-Bao,"An Asian restaurant with a Southeast Asian style, integrating dishes from many Asian countries. The dishes are not special but the waiters are very flexible and thoughtful, which deserves extra points."
Boa-Bao,"4 friends, we arrived without a reservation and the waiter offered us the bar apologizing that there was no room. Very kind. We ate very well: pat thai and green curry. Delicious food and great service."
Boa-Bao,"Exceptional Pad Thai and green curry, super courteous and attentive waiters. Nice bartenders. Very recommendable!!!"
Boa-Bao,Highly recommended The Cocktails that Alex prepares are spectacular.
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Good place for a snack, the cocktails were delicious. Omaima attended us, very attentive and charming."
Boa-Bao,Great food and service!
Boa-Bao,Really good service and some of the best asian food that I ve had in a long time :) (try their bao)
Boa-Bao,a little expensive for the quality of the food
Boa-Bao,"Went for dinner alone early on a Saturday. Arrived at 7pm, they didnt open til 7:30 pm, but I decided to wait, and Im glad I did. I got two apps and a bao. Everything was delicious. The cocktails are pretty and tasty. Thr bartenders were a bit disinterested, but the girl who ended up serving me at the bar was a delight! Great food, good value, fun place. Highly recommended."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Very touristy place...with very limited portions...although the food is tasty. They dont let you celebrate a birthday with a mini cake from outside the premises. Little empathy for all the expense. In addition, the prices of the menu are without VAT. Expensive"
Boa-Bao,"Delicious and well priced for Barcelona, the portions are a bit small, but its worth it!"
Boa-Bao,"Located in a very nice gastronomic neighborhood in Barcelona, the setting and decoration is super attractive and original! We ordered vegetarian baos, some various starters. The signature drinks are delicious and at good prices. The unbeatable attention."
Boa-Bao,"An atmosphere that immerses you in the neo-industrial atmosphere. Something like a cyberpunk style where they take great care of detail. The menu has a variety of classic Asian food, signature cocktails and very original desserts."
Boa-Bao,"Restaurant tres convivial, je recommande. Lieu spacieux, avec une decoration chaleureuse. L equipe est tres sympa : jeune, dynamique et efficace. La nourriture est correcte. Delicieux cocktails, peut etre un peu trop glaces. La carte des boissons n est disponible qu en QR code. Cafe original. Un bon moment !"
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Bad. If you are allergic to something, dont come. Very very bad service. A terrible organization. The place is modern and thats where it ends. Expensive."
Boa-Bao,
Boa-Bao,"Very nice restaurant, very polite staff, lovely decoration but very average food. Wouldnt go back"
Boa-Bao,"The duck bao was terrible, the bread fell apart and the duck was very dry, it didnt taste like anything, just sauce. The cuttlefish didnt taste like anything either, I havent tried anything worse. A displeasure and a disappointment because we were really looking forward to seeing the scores... the raw material was a zero."
Roots & Rolls,Excellent
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Quality sushi but nothing special. Price definitely too high.
Roots & Rolls,An incredible experience every time we go
Roots & Rolls,The restaurant is very spacious and big. A lot of space and nice design. A very helpful waiter. Its a bit annoying that most of the time its open only in the evening. Doesnt really work for a weekday lunch (only Friday). I like food but it wasnt extraordinary. Im not vegan myself so expect something that will wow me with vegan food. Here something was missing. Sushi was nice but not a lot of flavours.
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Vegetarian options: Alles vegan Food
Roots & Rolls,THE BEST vegan sushi I ve ever had. Hands down.
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"Very clean, excellent service, delicious food."
Roots & Rolls,I could say that it is one of the best brownies I have eaten in Barcelona.  . The sushi is small for the price. All very rich.
Roots & Rolls,Not the cheapest restaurant in town but very good quality/price ratio Vegetarian options: all is vegan Food : 4/5 |
Roots & Rolls,"We loved the food, it is difficult to get vegetable menus of this type and the flavors were a pleasant surprise. We booked super quickly through Google. They were very kind taking care of us. To suggest an improvement, I would change the type of coffee to one of better quality so that it lives up to the great dishes. We will repeat without a doubt. Ah! Delicious lemon dessert"
Roots & Rolls,Amazing sushi
Roots & Rolls,"The food as always was amazing! Creative vegan dishes with unique flavors. We tried about 10 different dishes and everything was delicious. Unfortunately we were at the restaurant during a night that the majority of the restaurant was used for a large event. This meant that only the 6 tables in the front corridor of the restaurant were being used and we were seated right by the front door. Every time the door opened we could feel a blast of cold air and the door makes a terrible squeaking noise (really needs some oil!). With at least 60 or 70 people coming and going we were constantly getting cold (it was about 8 degrees outside), there was constant foot traffic and the squeaking door. The staff also seemed to be very busy with the event and were less attentive than usual. For future reference it would be nice to inform regular guests of an event so you can decide if you still want to come. Dietary restrictions: Vegan and very allergy/intolerance friendly with good information"
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"A great night, good atmosphere, good food, good service!! And on top of that, respectful of the world all vegan!!!"
Roots & Rolls,"The tasting menu is a great way to try a lot of their food. Service was a little hit or miss, but the sushi was great."
Roots & Rolls,"Fair vegan sushi restaurant yet behind expectations. I had an awesome experience in a vegan sushi restaurant recently, so I decided to come to this one as the score and comments were even better than the other one, but unfortunately I did not find the same flavors and taste. We managed to share almost all the menu including desserts and cocktails (we were 6 people) and despite most of them being good enough only two of the them achieved the delicious category: Geisha roll and the bao Deluxe... Staff was very friendly, yet a bit slow. Fair to say that the restaurant was fully packed, so delays were comprehensible. The place is broad, nice and modern, industrial style. They have a private room for 10-12 people with a kotatsu style table. They also have another Japanese style table for 6 that sits in the main room yet feels like a more private/VIP because of the bars - TIP: book this one if you are group of 4 to 6... It is called the jail-. Worth to mention they are very pet friendly. Illustration: 2Eat, 2Drink, $$$, #asian, #japanese, #modern, #groups, #petfriendly"
Roots & Rolls,"At the quality/price level we thought it would be better. The dishes are different and not bad, but we expected more for the price. The attention of the waiters, great!"
Roots & Rolls,Amazing vegan sushi and cheesecake !
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"Very good quality vegan sushi, perfectly rolled and with fresh ingredients. The ambience is very elegant and service very attentive"
Roots & Rolls,"I went to Roots & Rolls for my Bday last year when I was in Barcelona and really enjoyed it. The food is understated and not over done, clean and delicious. The energy and art in the space were really cool too, overall great time, its a must visit."
Roots & Rolls,"Amazing place. So tasty and very good atmosphere. We loved everything we ordered, and it felt so healthy too. Highly recommended to visit roots & rolls!"
Roots & Rolls,"We came to celebrate a birthday and we had a great time! The food was delicious, the place was very nice and there was no noise. Also, the waitress Maria was very attentive. Vegetarian options: All"
Roots & Rolls,"Super recommended site! A very nice and very pleasant place with quality food and drinks. Special mention to the waitress Maria, very nice!!"
Roots & Rolls,"The truth is that the sushi was very delicious. What are you waiting for to come? Do it now, dont miss out on the rice. It never happens to them."
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"Excellent food and cocktails. If you are looking for a place to surprise someone with good food and unique flavors, this is your place. We loved it. The possibility of having tasting dishes seemed fantastic to us so as not to be left wanting to try everything. Also having a free cocktail for being your birthday, a great detail. Vegetarian options: Everything is vegan and delicious."
Roots & Rolls,Great food and friendly staff! :)
Roots & Rolls,"An incredible experience!! Incredibly good food, very nice restaurant and very friendly staff!"
Roots & Rolls,"The food is very good, and very elaborate. The price with drink and dessert is around 40  per person. Personally, I would say that the experience is not like eating traditional sushi (but veggie version) since the sushi pieces have an additional elaboration. The place is cozy, and the waiters are very friendly and attentive at all times. As a point to improve the service, I would say that it is the protocols for serving or setting up the table. The fundamental protocols of changing cutlery or serving dishes without invading the diners front space, asking for something when the persons mouth is not full, etc. Nothing major, but in case it helps to achieve excellence :) Vegetarian options: The whole menu is veggie, so great."
Roots & Rolls,"Buzzing atmosphere, comfortable seating, staff were on it and very friendly. Menu was top notch, a must for veggies and vegans."
Roots & Rolls,"Food was amazing! Lovely place for vegans to eat sushi. Food is quite pricey although I would say that it s worth the price, service was good, food came around 5-8 minutes after we ordered and our waiter asked us if the food was good or if we needed anything here and there. The restaurant is full of beautiful paintings and sculptures with jazzy-esce music in the background. Would recommend!!"
Roots & Rolls,A very interesting and artistic place. Delicious and super healthy food.
Roots & Rolls,"All perfect! The food is great, they have a small menu with Japanese-style dishes and 4 or 5 varieties of sushi, all vegan, of course. The place is very spacious and beautiful, with several works of art hanging for sale. The service was very good even as we arrived at 10:30, they told us that we did not have much time to order, since the kitchen was about to close. We will definitely return! Thank you! Vegetarian options: 100x100 vegan food"
Roots & Rolls,"In the reservation I said it was for a wedding celebration. When I arrived at the reserved table, I had the pleasant surprise that they had put a detail of two fabric hearts, and I really liked it. The table was also in a hallway where people were constantly passing by, and the waiter, on his own initiative, offered us another table less exposed, to which we accept. I expected the detail of the hearts to come with us, but he took them and put them in his pocket and we never knew about them again the detail they had had with us remained  ugly. The quality of the food is good, but it took a long time to wait between dishes (about 10 minutes) we ordered 4 different dishes + dessert For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake, reading the ingredients. It was very delicious, but there was an ingredient that they did not detail (we had to ask, after the incident) My partner is allergic to coconut, and nowhere did it say that it had coconut butter (normally they specify the ingredients quite a bit on the menu and also by type of allergen) but someone forgot to detail this ingredient, and my partner already had it at the first bite. He detected that he had coconut, and his tongue and lips became swollen. I read the ingredients again, raised my hand and asked the waitress if it had coconut because he had eaten it and is allergic. He immediately came back saying yes, and left. We asked for the bill 3 times to leave, since my partner was already experiencing things that we had to go to the pharmacy, he himself went to the counter to pay because no one came and we left in a hurry. (the dishes in the photo, plus two bottles that are filled from the tap  66.80) No one asked us how we were, no one offered help, no one had any kind of consideration in explaining what was happening, and I saw the waitress explain to 2 other people in the restaurant what had happened. Finally he was quite scared because we went to the nearest pharmacy to buy Ventolin. Ive been 3 times, but it will be the last. Update 2/12/24 They contacted me by phone, which I couldnt answer, to ask my partner to come. They sent me an email to contact me and inform me that they updated the menu with ingredients that were not detailed and they had the gesture of offering us a gift voucher with the amount of the dinner. With this gesture (and not only for the invitation, but for what was described above) I have added stars for customer service."
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"A beautiful place with the downside that mild flavors seem to be prohibited, 80% of the menu is full of chili (among other spicy ones) and it doesnt let you appreciate how delicious they would be. The desserts were 10/10, the drink options did not match the quality expected of the place. The waiters attention was fair and edge-wise, they really didnt want us to stay much longer so they could close earlier. (Here we can only speculate that the employees are underpaid or that the owners dont know what happens when they are away.) If you sit in a booth, far from asking permission, you will end up with several knees in your back, but this was already funny to us at least. We will not return, we can make more of what we spend in places where we are more comfortable."
Roots & Rolls,Avocado maki are overpriced considering how small they were. Miso Ramen was ok. The heura karaage was excellent.
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"We wanted to try vegan sushi and we had the first experience here. The entrance of the place looks like an art gallery! Once inside you find some comfortable armchairs and the decoration is a very authentic style that reminds me of those very modernist New York style warehouses, I loved the decoration. We ordered the grilled gzoyas as a starter, which we really liked, although for my taste it had too much cumin that took over all the flavor. We then ordered the tray which came with a selection of various makis and visually it was very appetizing. What happened to us is that we came with the idea of trying makis that imitated the sushi we are used to but instead we found vegetable makis that were more like eating cold vegetable rice. Some makis were made with very coarse grain rice and wild rice, which are rice that I like and usually consume but hot, not cold. I left the restaurant with the impression that I had tried a lot of cold vegetable rice! I would try more dishes again but in summer when the heat gets stronger and I want to eat this type of food more."
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Very creative food
Roots & Rolls,"This place was on my to-visit list for a long time now, so I was looking forward to eating here. I had the Say Cheese roll and the Heura. The heura was delicious and, for the meat eaters out there, it was indistinguishable from meat! The Say Cheese roll left me a bit dissatisfied. I was very much looking forward to the cashew cheese cream, but when they brought me the dish, it had only a little bit of the cream inside, unlike all the pictures with dollops of it on top. I had to ask the waiter what was going on, and only then did they bring me kimchi to compensate. Still, I feel a little bit disappointed. Nevertheless, the flavour was good. Apart from that, everyone was very nice and the interior is beautiful. Vegetarian options: Fully vegan menu"
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Wonderful experience
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"Brutal, I cant say anything else. Each dish is perfectly prepared, very tasty, you can see the quality and the desire that goes into this project."
Roots & Rolls,"Food was okay, but nothing to rave about. One point of attention, avoid the sangria at all cost it s very very bad"
Roots & Rolls,"Everything was excellent, from the different and very well prepared food, the staff, all very polite and professional from head to toe, the exquisite drinks and desserts, the relaxed and spacious atmosphere of the restaurant. We were delighted and eager to try more dishes on the menu. Vegetarian options: Very well made vegan"
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Delicious food! Very friendly staff and the restaurant is very nice and modern. I recommend 100%
Roots & Rolls,"A wonderful place, I am a born carnivore but I loved the vegan dishes, the place and the service. 100% recommendable."
Roots & Rolls,"Very good place for a vegan dinner in Barcelona. The quality of the food is very good, within a medium range, but the service is really TOP. WE WILL BE BACK"
Roots & Rolls,"Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and most of all delicious food - very colourful, tasty, and diversified. And everything is 100% vegan"
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Bravisimoooooooooooo
Roots & Rolls,It was my first time going and also trying vegan sushi and the truth is that it was wonderful. Everything was great except that the service spoke to us in English as a default and that is not very good. We will still return.
Roots & Rolls,"Very very good experience. The taste of every single dish was spot on. The complimentary cocktail on your birthday is a nice touch. It is on a pricey end of the vegan spots in Barcelona, so maybe thats an everyday treat, but its worth visiting from time to time. Vegetarian options: 100% vegan, making it easy to share all the dishes. Dietary restrictions: Plenty of Gluten Free options, including the cheesecake, which was brilliant. All is well marked in the menu."
Roots & Rolls,"Best birthday meal ever! Sushi is out of this world, so delicious, best sushi I have ever had. All plant based menu. Highly recommend! Vegetarian options: Entirely vegan menu"
Roots & Rolls,"I love it, the food is incredible and the place too, always a success but I feel a little bad that they automatically address you in English, the locals also consume their product, we recommend and support the business and it is important that this be taken into account"
Roots & Rolls,Great vegan spot with lots of mouthwatering options! Highly recommended!
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"The menu is nice and the food was tasty however I ll have to criticize the service. The personal was nice but the service was very poor. There is two-three waiters and 4 tables occupied, we got to order pretty quickly and smoothly however two out of three dishes  came and one of the dish was waiting at the bar for 10mn. No one moved or thought about delivering the dish. 10mn later someone finally decided to bring the plate that was just sitting there. We order quite little first courses and we wanted to order more so when the empty plates got picked up we expected the personal to ask if we wanted something else to eat or some water at least as our glasses were empty but nothing. I have to point out again that there is two to three waiters and 4 tables occupied. I feel a bit bad writing this as they were nice and the food was pretty good but a bit of common sense and a service mind would be appreciated. This is stuff u could see happening on low staff and a packed restaurant but it was the opposite today. I insist on the fact that the food was good and the staff was nice so it s still definetly worth visiting"
Roots & Rolls,"Ideal, creative, innovative and flexitarian & vegan. Good healthy bet in Barcelona!"
Roots & Rolls,"I went with my partner for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was at 25% occupancy. A waiter greeted us when we were already at the back and it seems that it was a problem to locate us having practically the entire place free. In short, I found the attitude listless. Regarding the place, it is very nice, it is well decorated and very well located. The quality of the sushi is very good, I would say 4/5."
Roots & Rolls,"This place is close to my apartment so it caught my attention as a vegetarian who loves Asian food. I was too excited to see that they are on Too Good to Go. I picked up an order that cost  5. It took 10 minutes to get my food but it was worth it. I received two delicious and fresh rolls. Seeing the prices on the normal menu it seemed very fair to me They didnt tell me what rolls they were exactly but it was some sweet potato, walnuts and avocado with a peanut sauce. A pretty good flavor"
Roots & Rolls,Amazing tasty food!!! Trust me   Im frequent traveler to Japan and eating vegan japanese food worldwide for few years. This place definitely would be in my best 3 places with vegan rolls/sushi and ramen!!! Tryed all rolls ans sushi and they are all 10 from 10!!
Roots & Rolls,"At first we thought it is a small restaurant, but if you go through the glass door a big room opens. All waiters were friendly and our waiter took the time to recommend and helped us by picking out the food. The sushi was delicious and not the normal typs. Also the starters and dessert was great."
Roots & Rolls,"Entirely vegetable vegan sushi, very good and unique. Also tried in pad Thai and soup. The gyoza are delicious and the fried cauliflowers as an appetizer. Particular and exclusive. Very comfortable environment due to the presence of original works of art"
Roots & Rolls,"It was a nice place, considering that good vegetarian sushi options are not many. The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere."
Roots & Rolls,"We really enjoyed our visit to Roots & Rolls just after Christmas. It seemed a bit iffy at first, but I think that was likely due to some staff arriving shortly after we did. It quickly improved and our server was outstanding. The food was delicious and it was a solid value. We would absolutely return."
Roots & Rolls,Amazing food with amazing service.. must go . We loved the food and the ambience. Heaven for vegans and vegetarians. Must try..
Roots & Rolls,"The food was amazing and the price was also fair. We had this tasting menu, and the dessert at the end was marvellous. Food"
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"The back part is nice and the kitchen is good. It left a bad taste in our mouths when they charged us for tap water at  2.5 per 50cl (in fact, I dont even think its legal)."
Roots & Rolls,"The dish I ate didnt taste like anything, I ordered a Ramen. The pasta was not cooked at all, the tofu had no taste at all and the broth was flavourless. Really very disappointing. Maybe I chose wrong. I was the last of the large group who was taken note of and I had to order the drink at the bar. Disappointed, sorry."
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Vegan dishes with lots of flavor and excellent presentation. The cocktails are also very good.
Roots & Rolls,"The vegan food at this restaurant is absolutely fantastic, with a unique Asian twist that sets it apart from other options in the area. The flavors are bold and delicious, and its clear that a lot of thought and care has gone into creating each dish. One small critique, however, is that the portion size of the pad thai could have been more generous for the price. While the flavors were on point, some diners may feel that they didnt quite get their moneys worth in terms of the amount of food they received. However, this is a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, and the overall quality of the food more than makes up for it. Overall, this restaurant is a must-visit for vegans and non-vegans alike, offering a truly unique and satisfying dining experience."
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,The food was delicious from the apples to the mains and desert! Service was great and the ambiance lovely. We really enjoyed our meal here and will be going back for sure. Highly recommend
Roots & Rolls,"This place never ceases to amaze me. I love everything they serve. I try to eat all that I order every time, but I fail every single time  . The geisha is to die for. I wasnt too fond of the say cheese. Perhaps it was the seaweed contrasting against the cream cheese that was a bit too intense for me. The spring rolls are insane. They got just the right texture, that sharpness of the pickles that cuts through the crunchy crust. Best dipped in soy sauce. The coconut ice cream is enough to knock you off your feet. I cannot imagine what the brownie will do to you. Brace yourself. Dietary restrictions: Youre safe if youre vegan."
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,Really amazing food! A must try as a veggie/vegan person
Roots & Rolls,
Roots & Rolls,"Everything is very good, the attention is also very good! I recommend it!"
Roots & Rolls,Best vegan sushi ever!!!
Roots & Rolls,"A Culinary Gem in Barcelona From the moment I stepped into Roots & Rolls, I knew I was in for a unique experience. This isnt just another vegan eatery; its a revolutionary take on Japanese cuisine, reimagined through a plant-based lens. The ambiance struck a perfect balance between modern chic and cozy comfort, setting the stage for an extraordinary culinary journey. The highlight, without a doubt, was their vegan sushi. Each roll was a masterpiece, both visually and on the palate. The Hip Caroots was a revelation   a colorful medley of flavors and textures, so artfully crafted that each bite felt like a celebration. But the magic didnt stop there. The Roots Pad Thai was a symphony of Pad Thai, while the Ramen Miso transported me straight to the bustling streets of Tokyo. Their innovative approach to traditional Japanese dishes, using plant-based ingredients, was nothing short of culinary wizardry. The staff deserves a special mention too. Attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about their offerings, they made the dining experience even more delightful. And the finale? A vegan cashew cheesecake that was the perfect harmony of sweet and earthy tones   a fitting end to a meal that was as much an adventure as it was dinner. Roots & Rolls isnt just a restaurant; its a testament to the creativity and possibilities of vegan cuisine. Whether youre a long-time vegan or just sushi-curious, this place is a must-visit in Barcelona. Its not just about eating; its about experiencing food thats crafted with care, imagination, and respect for the planet."

Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,Delicious tapas
Bubita Sangria Bar,Really disappointed. Food is very small. I had paella with vegan sea food. Baby portion. Overpriced and clearly microwaved. The staff looks so bored. I wanted to try. I did. Will not return. That s a shame cuz the place is cute. Hope this review will be helpful.
Bubita Sangria Bar,We came here in February on a weekday for lunch. It was such a peaceful and comfortable outdoor seating in the sun. The paella was awesome. Drinks were great too. Friendly staff.
Bubita Sangria Bar,Very cute place located in a small square next to the Gothic area. Vegan tapas that surprised us even though we werent vegan. Very good sangria. Highly recommended
Bubita Sangria Bar,"This plant-based brunch spot not only delights with its creative selection of dishes and drinks, but also captivates with its warm atmosphere and attentive, friendly staff. From the first moment you walk in, you feel welcome and well cared for. Without a doubt, a must-see destination for vegan food lovers and those looking for a different gastronomic experience enjoying the local art or the sun on its terrace."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Great sangrias and food, but caution, they are asking for tips here when you pay, as percentages starting at 5% and going up to something like 20%.  This is not typical in this region, and I get the feeling that they are doing this because a lot of Americans come here."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Amazing sangria very nice stuff!
Bubita Sangria Bar,Very good vegan paella options. Went there with my non-vegan relatives and friend and even they liked it a lot. Can really recommend. Vegetarian options: Vegan restaurant

Bubita Sangria Bar,"A nice, modern twist to the Sangria. Really cozy ambience!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Perfect! We loved the food, the service, and the place Their paellas are heavenly, but could maybe be a little stronger in flavour. We havent tried the tapas, but it looked mouth-watering. The cocktail I ordered (Frida) was very good. The outdoor seating is comfortable and the interior is cute. The waiter speaks English really well. What a nice wrap for our sisters trip to Barcelona."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Delicious food and a cosy atmosphere. Would recommend!
Bubita Sangria Bar,"I love this place! Very local and cool atmosphere and yet the food is delicious! I had the paella with mushrooms that was great. As a vegetarian, this was the first time I had a paella and it s definitely was delicious! The sangria is also great!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"I ate the vegan tapas, and it was not tasty. Bad value for money. Bad service. Toilets were not working, and no hand soap. Food"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Oh my  brilliant food and awesome cocktails. You must visit now.
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Delicious, must stop for Sangria! They offer quite a few options. I enjoyed one out of a skull shaped cup. The interior was cozy and lively for mid-afternoon drinks. We also got the Bubitas Dips and they were all so tasty, you d never know it was vegan!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Great to have vegan paella but i was hoping for more variety of  seafood  sangria was good
Bubita Sangria Bar,just disappointing. The fact that you pay money for something like that is just a blatant impudence!!! never come here again

Bubita Sangria Bar,"Its a vegan place, but you only realise that once you scan a menu. Personnel is unskilled and unwelcoming staring at their phones all the time. Also its pay by card only which is unacceptable for me (also not pointed out anywhere but the bar). And for such a place to have plastic flowers was just a last drop for me personally. Didnt like it, dont recommend it"
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Good vegan paella, good drink, good time. Paella was too small for the price though."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Delicious vegan Paella and Brownie! Nice atmosphere but the servings could be a little bit bigger :)
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Best sangria in Barcelona, it was an amazing place to have my birthday brunch, the vegan cheese was insane! Can t wait to go back! Vegetarian options: The best vegan bar in Barcelona!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Great all vegan restaurant. A variety of sangrias to choose from and the paellas were amazing. Feb 2024 update: still an amazing vegan eat place. Food
Bubita Sangria Bar,Very tasty food   Staff also very friendly!
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Visited this place twice during a short holiday to Barcelona. The food menu is relatively small - tapas platters, paella, gnocci or dips. I tried the seafood tapas platter which had a great selection of prawns, calamari and absolutely loads of olives. I had the mushroom paella on my second visit, It had a nice selection of different mushrooms in it. I also had the lemon and ginger tart which was very filling. I ried one of the sangri options which was a bit strong for my taste, so I stuck to the red wine which was good. All servers are very smiley and friendly but service was a little slow at times. Thankfully, this place has a really nice atmosphere with low lighting so I wasnt in a rush."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"What an amazing meal. A full Spanish food experience but Vegan. Im vegetarian with a milk intolerance, so this place was ideal while visiting Barcelona. My partner eats meat, but didnt miss it at all here. Food was amazing, we had the paellas and brownies, and the drinks were delicious. Staff was so pleasant and the atmosphere was casual and just fun. Dietary restrictions: All dishes are Vegan, so ideal for Vegans, vegetarians, and people with milk and egg allergies."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Wonderful place, delicious food and the staff is very welcoming. The food was a little bit pricey, but definitely worth it, and the cocktail was very delicious. Vegetarian options: every thing was vegetarian"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Great little bar with incredible sangria! Well worth a visit for a chilled time with drinks!
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Cute shop, cozy atmosphere, good vegan food but not a taste explosion as hoped (we lacked the spice), sangria large but super sweet, overall the price-performance ratio was just okay"

Bubita Sangria Bar,"Nice sangria. Bad tapas. Food was reheated, kind of hard and lacked flavour. Served us cold baked beans? Food"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"The place is nice, it has few tables, the food is delicious. Vegetarian options: The food had a great presentation, it had very good flavor, the vegan shrimp, they do look like shrimp! It was good. Although my daughter didnt like the pancakes because they had red berries on top and they were sour. For the rest it was good. I felt the prices were a little high. 1 glass of sangria  10, the snack board  35"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Cetait un super moment, une cuisine impeccable. Une planchette de tapas vegetale tres bien elabore,  ce nest absolument pas un probleme de consommer autre chose que de la viande avec regal ! Un service de qualite,  merci a lequipe pour la soiree, Je recommande cet endroit les yeux fermes"

Bubita Sangria Bar,"You can stop in for a good sangria. The place is quite expensive, more Instagrammable than typically Spanish."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Beautiful courtyard, great room, food is quite good, a bit fancy..."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Excellent vegan restaurant near Barceloneta. The vegan paella is very good, both the meat and fish versions! Dietary restrictions: Vegan"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Excellent vegan experience
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Unfortunately, we can only rate the sangria cocktails here, which we unfortunately didnt like at all. Service and ambience was ok."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Delicious vegan food. Second time we were here...and that says something.
Bubita Sangria Bar,I got food poisoning from this restaurant and was extremely ill for 2 days following eating here. The service was good and so was the atmosphere but unfortunately we lost out on a couple days of our holiday.
Bubita Sangria Bar,Delicious dishes... Exceptional experience
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Absolutely magical atmosphere, served the BEST vegan paella I have ever had! Highly recommend this place"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Such a marvellous vegan experience
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Endroit sympa, service OK, mais on a ete malade apres avoir bu une sangria. On a pris une paella OK mais qui baignait dans l huile. Dommage ca pourrait etre tellement mieux."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Interesting place with decent food options.
Bubita Sangria Bar,The food looks great but taste really bad  even the seafood not the real seafood but  looks like .. it s good for girls taking beautiful pictures but it s flavor .

Bubita Sangria Bar,"a bit expensive, but the taste makes up for it, its worth it :)"
Bubita Sangria Bar,We stopped for a lovely brunch in this quiet corner of the square. Beautiful bagels and pancakes with delicious condiments. Great food with a great laid back atmosphere. Highly recommend everyone to try this place.
Bubita Sangria Bar,What a lovely place! I really enjoyed the bagel <3
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Good sangria options. Was unclear about how they serve, but going inside to order and pay was a success at least."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"We shared tapas, a paella and two sangrias. It was very good, and the vegan  shrimp  and  squid  were excellent. However, the prices are still quite high."
Bubita Sangria Bar,"The food at Bubita was amazing!! I had the vegan seafood plater and the Monalisa cocktail. Both were perfection and I definitely recommend that you try them! The ambiance in the restaurant is also really nice and I love the location. Very romantic! The only thing I disliked about this restaurant was the service. I wasnt given a menu nor was I really greeted when I entered, I had to make myself seen. After sitting for a while, the server came and asked what I wanted. I told him that I didnt get a menu and he pointed to the QR code on the table. I didnt click that it was the menu as I had seen paper menus at the entrance... A bit bizarre that I wasnt offered one since they were readily available. I ordered the food and the server brought it over, but that was the extent of the service I got. He never came back to see if I needed anything else or to even offer water or ask if I wanted dessert. For this price point, I would expect better service from the wait staff, it was less than basic in my opinion."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Unfriendly and incompetent employees
Bubita Sangria Bar,"The food looks very nice, but tastes only OK, sometimes not fresh. The service is very bad, inattentive. Not recommended as there are so many other great restaurants in Barcelona. But the store has potential."
Bubita Sangria Bar,

Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Cute little ALL VEGAN establishment we came across in Barcelona. The food flavor was adequate and with good portions. You view the menu from your phone via a QRL code thats on the center of the table. You pay at the counter. The service was non existent. They were not rude mind you, just zero table side manner. Im glad I brought my own water with me. Once the items were brought to the table, all aspects of service evaporated. Would not recommend."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Very tasty vegan menu and also the cocktails were phenomenal! We loved the vibe and would definitely like to come back to try the rest of the menu.
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Very pleasant restaurant. Small tables, cozy lighting, the right music volume - perfect for two and stimulating conversations. I was there for dinner with two kids (8 & 6). We had gnocchi and calamari. The gnocchi were ok, the calamari could hardly be distinguished from  real  ones. Would have liked to try other things, but wanted to accommodate the kids love of fried foods. That was the best choice. Definitely come back! Its great that there are so many vegan restaurants in the city!!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Good sangria but you can find it cheaper
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Excellent food, prices a little high but justified by the environment"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Lovely place with a beautiful atmosphere and nice drinks, but most of all super delicious vegan food. The paella was really good and the cheese we had on our plate was one of the best vegan cheese wed ever had."
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Quaint interior, all vegan menu, great service! The sangrias (alcoholic and virgin) were great, with the Salome being our favorite. We shared the Pasion Mediterrania, Baked Gnocchi, and Setas Silvestres. The food was good and enough to share. We would definitely return for the sangria! Vegetarian options: Everything is plant-based, so take your pick of the menu!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Excellent sangria, helpful guys, limited places, excellent tapas.......go there."
Bubita Sangria Bar,Good vegan option in El Born. The food was good and at a reasonable price. The restaurant is located on a cute square with a cool vibe and there are tables outside. The portions (especially the pancakes) were a bit small. Vegetarian options: Everything is vegan
Bubita Sangria Bar,An absolute must for me! Very tasty vegan cuisine and the tapas (seafood style) are so delicious!
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Had the most amazing vegan tapas platter and sangria here! Even my husband, who is not vegan, was blown away by the food. You have to come here."
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Beautiful day place, amazing food, the price is ok, you get what you pay for and the staff is very friendly! The best I had in BCN, I d definitely come back Dietary restrictions: Incredible vegan paella, and vegan tapas and everything honestly!!"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Spectacular place for vegans and non-vegans. Delicious Spanish Vibes tapas, bubita dips, and gnocchi. We tried the Jessica and Sancta Inquisitione sangrias, all 10 points. Very nice attention and beautiful place! We will return"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Very pricey for the amount of food
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Place in the center of the old city, welcoming, bright and well furnished. Traditional Spanish cuisine dishes with a vegan twist. I had a wonderful lunch with paella and a huge platter of vegan prawns and calamari. Advise Vegetarian options: Vegan dishes"
Bubita Sangria Bar,"Cuisine simple mais gouteuse. La presentation des plats attise la gourmandise.Les sangrias, toutes plus imaginatives les unes que les autres sont excellentes...Une escale gouteuse dans une ambiance conviviale ! Vegetarian options: Restaurant vegan"
Bubita Sangria Bar,Amazing vegan platter and great sangria! The paella was not as good as the rest but still recommend to go and try out the platters.
Bubita Sangria Bar,
Bubita Sangria Bar,"I can recommend this place, it was neat and with a great atmosphere. You can sit inside or outside and also pay by a card."
Pepito Restaurante,They can really cook well. A bit chaotic at times
Pepito Restaurante,Blah. Not very good.
Pepito Restaurante,Disappointing.  Came here last night in Barcelona after going to a number of good restaurants. Food was good but way overpriced for quality and quantity.
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,"A famous store in a back alley. Its hidden on a road a little way from Casa Mila. Ive been there many times. I have also used it for dinner, and I ate several dishes there, and they were all very delicious. For lunch, I always eat 5-year aged meat called Vaca. This is a chunk of steak, and its probably hard to find in Japan. It is recommended."
Pepito Restaurante,"If you come to Barcelona you cant miss dinner here! The guy who greeted us was super nice and helpful with my fiances countless allergies. They were super attentive, the meat was delicious, they brought us a lava stone separately to regulate the cooking of the meat... truly an original and quality place!"

Pepito Restaurante,"The place is very beautiful and the food was brutal, highly recommended."
Pepito Restaurante,"Excellent restaurant. It has a varied menu, very good product quality and preparation of the dishes. I went with 3 friends and we opted for the meats so we will have to return to continue trying the menu. Both the entrails, the Galician blonde beef steak, the steak tartare and the hamburger are highly recommended. I also highlight the veal sweetbreads, which I especially liked."
Pepito Restaurante,Dietary restrictions: Food
Pepito Restaurante,"Quiet place with ideal decoration for a romantic date. The omelet coulant is sensational, without a doubt the best dish we tried. The service is extremely attentive and friendly."
Pepito Restaurante,It s a very comfortable restaurant.We had great dinner time.
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,The menu is quite expensive for what it is. The chicken was very bland And very little variety of vegetables
Pepito Restaurante,"Good intention in serving good dishes but they turned out to be bland and half cold. Nice space and friendly staff. Quite high price, especially for the result."
Pepito Restaurante,Tapha Amar amazing!
Pepito Restaurante,Nice place with great food options.
Pepito Restaurante,"This Pepito is quite a discovery. The decoration of the room, with its sofas, its somewhat dim lighting and the ambient music make it really cozy. The service is attentive and very friendly. And delicious food. A luxury in the center of Barcelona."
Pepito Restaurante,"Ufff, this place is highly recommended, I want to return. Delicious"
Pepito Restaurante,"Dirty seats, bad cleaning, found some piece of sweets on the seat twice and left the place."
Pepito Restaurante,"I ve been at Pepito many times but my today s experience (Feb 24) has been terrible. My rice ( arros negre  or  black rice ) was too cooked by far and instead of being an almost  dry rice , it was made with a great amount of oil. Difficult to eat. The  cecina  was also of bad quality. The decoration is very nice, as always, but the rest of things have changed a lot (food, service). What a disappointment. Don t make the same mistake going there. There are so many good restaurants in Barcelona to waste your money at Pepito. It really seems now a restaurant to sell supposedly Spanish food to tourists at a price."
Pepito Restaurante,"Youre going to pay double what its worth. I went thinking that I would be surprised by the evaluations and nothing has surprised me, neither for quality, nor quantity, nor for being different... Nothing. We ordered a ceviche, milanesa, meloso, tiramisu and brownie. Everything was normal, what I ate would have cost me half as much anywhere else and with the same quality. The worst thing is the deception of the homemade potatoes, I did not like at all that they sold me homemade potatoes when they were frozen... You cannot deceive the customer like that, that a potato cut and fried in the restaurant has nothing to do with a frozen one, I felt cheated and finally I felt cheated with the desserts, they didnt offer me a dessert menu, I didnt see the price, I thought it would be the normal price,  5 approx. When I saw that each dessert was  7.50... What a scam. For what I paid, I would have eaten much better anywhere else."
Pepito Restaurante,"Well decorated restaurant with camouflaged simplicity. For the price you pay  88 (one starter, two main courses and dessert) you expect something that will surprise you, that will be different and worth the money, but it wasnt like that... We came with high expectations due to the ratings Google and it has let us down. Also, while the staff has been friendly, the service has been slow and there werent that many people to justify it either. All in all, we wont be back."
Pepito Restaurante,I have recently been with some friends and I loved it. The food and the venue are fantastic. The staff very friendly and attentive. I definitely recommend it and hope to return soon!
Pepito Restaurante,"Nice place. Very good quality food, good product, well cared for and cooked. The meat is excellent, it entails remarkable and excellent steak. The pepito is also highly recommended. High price but according to what you eat."
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,"Restaurant with a cozy atmosphere, good food and very good service. The dishes worth highlighting are the tortilla coulant, the tartare and the Angus entrails. One of those places you want to return to soon."
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,Tres bonne viande mais pour deux la quantite etait un peu faible.
Pepito Restaurante,"Very attentive and pleasant service. Good atmosphere, very well located next to Paseo de Gracia but quiet at the same time. Very delicious food, the porcini croquettes and the Milanese are very good. We would like some more options in desserts. We will repeat and recommend it."
Pepito Restaurante,"I went two years ago and yesterday, Saturday, February 10, I went again with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. When we went, the service was exquisite, the atmosphere had very calm and peaceful music and there was a warm and intimate atmosphere. The food is still good but remove one meat that was the top. This time, the service was terrible, they brought us the starter and the dishes at once, rushing us to eat, we had to repeat what we ordered several times and there were only 3 things. The atmosphere was super noisy, very loud music and therefore, people were talking much louder, that seemed like the happypark. We were really disappointed, the food is good but for what they charge, its better to go somewhere else where you can eat better and have quality service."
Pepito Restaurante,Dont get excited about the 4.3. The food is good but nothing great! A little expensive for what it is. Very friendly waiters! Very good decoration.
Pepito Restaurante,Delicious food
Pepito Restaurante,"A lot of  hype  created by social networks; turning out to be one more . Without further ado! Correct, nothing bad but nothing excellent either!"
Pepito Restaurante,"I went to dinner with my husband, and everything was delicious and spectacular, first time we went and I will return!!"
Pepito Restaurante,The food was top notch and the service was also excellent.
Pepito Restaurante,"Excellent atmosphere, excellent meals and good service from the nacho waiter... We will return"
Pepito Restaurante,"The room is very well decorated. The service is attentive and friendly (despite the fact that they do not speak or understand a word of Catalan). The menu is very different and has personality, the food is delicious. Maybe an expensive one. Highly recommended."

Pepito Restaurante,"Went here on Christmas day for dinner. Great food, friendly staff and the interior adds a nice ambience. When in Barcelona give Pepito a try!"
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,"Restaurant clearly aimed at wealthy tourists who are only looking for a luxurious place to show off. The bars decor is tasteful, although the seats are a bit hard. The service can be greatly improved considering that they are supposed to sell you luxury. Our waiter threw 3 cutlery on the floor. It may sound stupid but for the price they charge us everything should be impeccable. The food is delicious but extremely scarce. I had to have dinner at another bar after going out to fill up. The dessert came with a hair that wasnt mine and they thought it was good to hand it over. The restaurant appears more than it is. It needs more to become the high-class restaurant it tries to be."
Pepito Restaurante,"Nice looking place with decent food. Service was chaotic; some of our main courses were delivered 30 minutes after the others, drinks sometimes came and sometimes never arrived."
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,"!Absolutamente espectacular! Este lugar es increiblemente acogedor, con un servicio que simplemente deslumbra. La calidad de la comida merece un solido 10/10. Aunque el espacio es un poco reducido, esto anade un toque acogedor e interesante al ambiente. !Definitivamente una excelente opcion para aquellos que deseen probar algo nuevo en Barcelona!"
Pepito Restaurante,"A peculiar decoration, the food is good, without many surprises, little variety on the menu, the meats quite good. And the good desserts and pretty decoration"
Pepito Restaurante,"Whether it was the setting, the atmosphere or the cuisine, everything was perfect. In addition, our server Amar spoke French and was very pleasant. As a bonus: the prices are correct."
Pepito Restaurante,"It is in the center of the commercial area, but in a very quiet alley. Restaurant with very good decoration and quiet place. The food is very good and they have good coffee. We werent very hungry and we didnt have to try dessert. I recommend it."

They couldn t prepare a cocktail because we re just 2 waiters serving all the tables . Bad management Don t order the vaca vieja dish. Super expensive for what you get . A super dry poor beef meat taste .  No 60 days aged at all! No soft nor slender at all !!
Pepito Restaurante,"Pepito is a restaurant that surprises you with how beautiful it is. It is decorated with lights, candles, sofas... In general it is a perfect place for a romantic dinner. The menu is simple, but everything is very good and very well presented. The service is very attentive and friendly. We will repeat!"

Pepito Restaurante,"Une experience de grande qualite. Deja la decoration a un cachet certain, meme dans les toilettes. Ensuite le service est impeccable, avec un effort pour le francais, et souriant. Jai pris un tapas de veau avec une pointe de citron qui etait une tuerie, une coupe de sangria au cava excellente, un morceau de joue de porc fondant a souhait et une puree au truffe. La creme catalane en dessert etait surprenante de creativite, avec une legerete qui nest pas habituellement associee a ce plat. Le prix est moyen, vous pouvez vous en sortir pour 25  , sauf si vous craquez pour plusieurs plats comme moi. Du coup on y a reserve pour le lendemain. Reservation conseillee, surtout a partir de 14 heures."
Pepito Restaurante,Vraiment tres petite quantite pour un plat a 43 euros seulement une portion de frite pour 2 des ravioles a la truffe froide et en tres faible quantite. Beau cadre gache par tout cela vraiment restaurant a eviter .
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,I had a great dinner with an amazing french rose wine called Mirabal. The steak tartare was great and the coulant of potatoes.
Pepito Restaurante,"I recently dined at Pepito, a charming restaurant located just a 15-minute walk from the center of Barcelona, and I couldnt have been more pleased with my experience. Booking a table was a breeze, thanks to their user-friendly online reservation system, available both on their website and through Google. Its a convenient touch that sets the tone for a hassle-free evening. Upon arriving for dinner, I was immediately captivated by the wonderful ambiance. Dimmed lights, great vibes, and the perfect selection of music created an inviting atmosphere that made me feel right at home. While I regrettably didnt take any pictures to capture the moment, I can wholeheartedly recommend a few standout dishes that truly shone at Pepito. The padron pimentos, mushroom croquettes, and the salads were undeniable stars of the menu. These dishes not only pleased the palate but also reflected the restaurants commitment to delivering quality flavors. To complement the meal, Pepito offers a great selection of both red and white wines, catering to various tastes and preferences. In conclusion, Pepito offers an all-around delightful dining experience in Barcelona. From the easy booking process to the wonderful ambiance and standout dishes, its a restaurant that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for a memorable meal in the city."

Pepito Restaurante,Always super nice. Delicious food in one of the most beautiful places in BCN. And save room for dessert!!!
Pepito Restaurante,"Horrible food, with the extended variety of restaurants in Barcelona, please do not make the same mistake I did by going to this restaurant. The raviolis were disgusting. More than raviolis on a sauce, they were bath with oil, the provolone was not even possible to eat. We left it all. We didn t even dear to complain we just paid and left."
Pepito Restaurante,"Food good but not exceptional. Place not very well taken care of. Dirty seats, table not well cleaned and dirty toilets. Terrible service. First we received the wrong dish, second I got accused of wrongly ordering, and third I get asked, with the bill in front, how much do I want to pay. Leaving the place without a goodbye, has been the cherry on the cake."
Pepito Restaurante,"Very good restaurant   we had dinner and the food was delicious, the meat was just right, the service from the unbeatable waiters were super attentive. I recommend you"
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,Nous avons passe une excellente soiree. Le   service etait exceptionnel par Mr  tapha amar  merci a lui. lambiance est tres amicale le poisson est tres bien prepare.

Pepito Restaurante,"We took a package at Ambrosia Spa which included dinner at this restaurant. The truth is that everything was exquisite, from the starters to the meat, which was very good, the only thing that could be improved is the wine, but since it is a package it is understandable. The attention of the waiters was impeccable, mainly from Freddy who was very attentive all night and very friendly. We will return without any doubt"
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,"It was good but we expected much more, especially considering the prices. There were two waiters for the entire place, and that meant that the service was slow and there were some confusion, at all times they were very friendly although that is not always enough. The food was very good, although the ravioli could be improved. I want to think that it was a specific event, although I would not return."
Pepito Restaurante,"I liked the place, the place is very  cool , as well as its decoration and atmosphere. Agile service and very good food. We ordered the ceviche, one of the hamburgers, the steak tartare, the picanton and the meloso iberico. Very good choices. In addition, the menu is varied and you have plenty to choose from."
Pepito Restaurante,
Pepito Restaurante,We have eaten very well and they have treated us wonderfully.
Musiu,
Musiu,"For  11.90: medium/large portion of salad + pasta that was a little smaller but still tasted very good + a drink, for me it was a Cola Zero 0.33ml. Nevertheless, a very, very strong offer that was extremely worth it. The service was a bit stressful, but still extremely nice. Its worth eating there for good money."
Musiu,
Musiu,"The caprese salad and veggie pasta were quite tasty, affordable and the front patio is perfect for people watching. The staff are lovely and quite welcoming. Vegetarian options: My friend and I both ordered meals that were vegetarian. There are plenty of salad, pizza and pasta options that are vegetarian friendly."
Musiu,"Yes, yes, and yes! So good!"
Musiu,Excellent service... extremely fast; Their food and drinks are a great idea... 100% recommended
Musiu,"Very tasty food, with good prices. Friendly atmosphere"
Musiu,"Great food, quickest service in town. Literally 5 minutes after ordering we received our delicious pasta."
Musiu,"Yesterday we had a very unpleasant experience with the staff of this establishment. The treatment was anything but cordial: first they wanted to change our table due to a mistake by the waitress and, not happy with that, they still addressed us in a sarcastic and derogatory manner, so we decided to leave. You only have to read the responses to other critics to realize that professionalism is not exactly the distinguishing mark of this place. (Edit in response to owners comment): The lack of professionalism and poor quality start when the staff does not know how to address the customer, does not treat them politely (which is clear once again with the tone of the answer) and does not at any time take responsibility for their own mistakes: at work the solution must never come from the client, but from the worker who generated it. When a venue isnt up to par (and this one isnt), its better to do something else."
Musiu,"The bar and service staff were lovely. The dishes were very affordable but unfortunately, the food was basic. The chef didn t realise that I could hear him imitating my accent in the kitchen, which I thought was incredibly rude."
Musiu,"Firstly, the food was amazing. The service was fantastic. Especially Ariana who was phenomenal. Highly recommend for great food, great service and fantastic, friendly and accommodating staff."
Musiu,"Fast service, lovely food and great staff."
Musiu,
Musiu,The food was reheated in the microwave in my opinion. After dinner I had diarrhea. Salad was poorly seasoned. I would not repeat

Musiu,"Amazing crew, amazing service, and amazing food. The photo simply doesn t do the food justice. Absolutely love how homely and flavourful the Verduras pasta is and I m also impressed by the layers of flavours and textures of the house special salad. Might like my pasta a little bit more al dente but overall this is the definition of a happy meal to me."
Musiu,"Les plats sont delicieux, le personnel est tres sympa et l ambiance cool,  je recommande si vous etes de passage a barcelone !!!"

Musiu,"A great place to get amazingly tasty, fast served Italian pasta near the passeig de gracia avenue. Team is really friendly, professional, and you immediately feel welcomed. For lunch, ring them to get your reserve, as they open at 1pm and get full pretty quick. Great address in Barcelona as its very centric and they serve you fast."

Musiu,It was delicious. Thank Aldana for nice service :)
Musiu,"The place is nice and well decorated, with a small terrace at the entrance with a couple of tables. Italian people run it and that already says a lot about the place. I liked it, but perhaps I found something more typical missing, I went in with a craving for Roman carbonara, and in the end I made pear and gorgonzola fiocchi, obviously delicious. friendly and attentive staff."

Musiu,
Musiu,
Musiu,"There is something about small businesses and it is that they trust that what is good can start with a grain of sand. I stopped by because I thought there were very good things on their simple menu. I tried what is some of the best pasta I have ever eaten. Pasta with recipes. Good consistency in the sauce, the cooking of the pasta was on point. Very friendly and on time service. Friendly price."

Musiu,Super delicious food with great prices. It was very quick and the staff was super friendly. Definite recommendation!
Musiu,"Very good pasta Not very expensive meal On the other hand, very expeditious, I ordered a beer, 2 minutes later my dish had already arrived.. too bad"
Musiu,"Excellent Italian food in Barcelona, it is recommended to go early because it gets busy at noon. The place is small and somewhat noisy but it is worth it. Very good attention. I recommend it, it doesnt fail."

Fisterra,Truly thieves. I didnt eat anything and the price was 10 euros for 4 poor croquettes and I paid 10.80. Go your way. A shame !
Fisterra,"Great place for menu of the day! Fast, pleasant and quality food"
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,"I have been visiting it for a long time, it has good tapas, but lately they change waiters a lot and the tapas are smaller"
Fisterra,A place to eat Galician tapas and Galician desserts
Fisterra,
Fisterra,Never disappoints! One of the best places in the area for tapas!
Fisterra,"Regrettable attention. Waiter wouldnt let us sit at the table because 3 people from a reservation we requested had not yet arrived. When everyone is there, he begins to press to order without even having the cards. Unusual."
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,"I dont know if it has changed owners or what. The place was packed, which attracted me to enter. A real shame, fideua on the menu: there was no, skewers: burnt And on the second floor there is sea bass and they serve it to me with ANISAQUIS!!. Of course, I returned it, the waiter made me come to the cook to tell me that it was fresh. We left without eating, we paid  38 returning half of the menu and it was a disastrous experience. I dont know what so many people are doing in such a place."
Fisterra,Good tapas and correct price. Service a bit chaotic today to say the least.
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,Very good place to eat Traditional food and unbeatable service.
Fisterra,It is our trusted site always. It is homemade and quality food. The service is a love
Fisterra,Very good menu of the day
Fisterra,I love this site
Fisterra,We have gone for a mid-day menu and the truth is that they serve very quickly and the value for money is great.
Fisterra,
Fisterra,Kitchen only opened at 19:00 even though showing opened at 17:30
Fisterra,"The tapas are good although it depends which ones, the quality has worsened now the more overheated and salty food. The terrace is pleasant but the service when it fills up is a bit chaotic and above all borderline, especially the manager who is very unfriendly and does not have a sad detail even though she consumes heavily. They benefit from the fact that there are not many options in the area but for that price the quality and especially the service is more than questionable."
Fisterra,Menu meal for four. Agile service. Clean premises with two terraces and interior.
Fisterra,"They have a very reasonably priced daily menu. The varied and well-prepared food, all this in a good atmosphere and pleasant terrace."
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,Relaxed place with tasty simple food.

Fisterra,"Very good option to eat, delicious food and excellent service, Irene super friendly and professional, we will repeat!"
Fisterra,
Fisterra,Very good service and menu
Fisterra,Local spot with English menu. We had tapas and they came in much larger portions than every other place we had them (in the tourist neighbourhoods) The menu was reasonably priced and worth a visit if youre willing to venture out to this area.
Fisterra,
Fisterra,
Fisterra,Short 15-minute walk from our hotel Hilton Diagonal De Mar. The food and service were great. Dont let the outside stop you from experiencing this little gem.
Fisterra,"Good afternoon. Lunch for 2 people, everything was good, the octopus a little soft, the service very friendly but overwhelmed they couldnt attend to everyone as they would have liked"
Fisterra,"Perfect for any time, vermouth, daily menu, dinners or a good paella on the weekend. Fresh and quality product. Two terraces and great atmosphere"
Fisterra,"The menu is cheap, but its better to have a sandwich somewhere else if youre in a hurry. Ridiculous dishes!"
Fisterra,"Good restaurant to eat good tapas and different dishes. Friendly and attentive staff at all times, fast and served quickly."
Fisterra,Good tapas at reasonable prices
Fisterra,Excellent food and the staff were wonderful. We ve tried tapas and breakfast and everything was so tasty and good portions.we loved everything about this place. If in the area this is a must location to try the food.
Fisterra,"A good restaurant to make a good vermouth or to eat, it has an extensive menu, the dishes are very complete, and they cook very well... they have an outdoor terrace or you can eat in the interior room. Parking: It is in a difficult area to park, unless you go on Saturday or Sunday because you can park in the bus lane."

Fisterra,
Fisterra,Expensive and poor quality food. Ridiculous
Fisterra,I think I have paid for a bottle of water this expensive only on the Tour Eiffel in Paris.
Fisterra,"I dont recommend this place at all, the service is terrible, its really a disappointment"
Fisterra,"The dinner I saw today was very bad, terrible service! Even better is seeing the boys training outside!"
Fisterra,Very expensive and bad environment not recommended
Fisterra,"The food was good, but from there everything was bad, some racists, terrible service"
Ginos,
Ginos,"I went at noon and the menu was very good, for  1 you could order a second drink, which was appreciated, the service was fast and pleasant."
Ginos,We have been several times and it is always a success. The food is excellent and the service exceptional. We will be back!!!
Ginos,"I went to dinner and the manager made me leave because  apparently  it is not allowed for acquaintances of the employees to come to eat. I live next to the shopping center, do I have to go somewhere else to eat? Absurd"
Ginos,
Ginos,"We had dinner on a Friday night before 9 p.m. Almost empty restaurant. They took time to take our notice and even longer to serve us. They gave my wife a pizza that was not the one she had ordered. Since he feels bad that they have to throw it away and make another one, he accepts it. In my case, my dish arrived when she had almost finished eating and with the surprise that it was spicy when it shouldnt be, which ended up making me feel bad. They tell me that they have new staff and they must have made a mistake. In short, I dont even have the desire for dessert, although from what I heard they told the diners at the next table, they didnt have certain ingredients either and I would have run out anyway. Of course, the full bill, neither an apology nor compensation."
Ginos,"Ginos very good quality in their food, they have a very gentle and professional service. On Sunday at Diagonal Mar they were full but a waiter very kindly informed me that they could offer me a table with a very correct and consistent waiting time. Thank you very much, I will always come back."
Ginos,
Ginos,"I go there several times for lunch alone and they always serve me perfectly. The waiters are very friendly and make you feel accompanied. The menu is very correct and it is a quiet place. Also, when I go there with my daughter they always give her things to paint and entertain herself. Ill be back for sure!"
Ginos,Everything super Good and the Attention Spectacular I will be back if or siiii Thanks!!!
Ginos,"Very good and good treatment, we will repeat!"
Ginos,
Ginos,
Ginos,"We always go to a place where staff dont know what time the kitchen closes, they rush to order and they also close the doors early with people on the terrace. I dont ask for the complaint form because there is no one but I, who am a chef in restaurants, will wait for them. to request the claim letter"
Ginos,The menu of the day for 15.95 is very good!
Ginos,"Horrible, once we received the drinks they informed us that they did not have certain products. Once the pizzas were ordered, they later came to inform that they also did not have bacon and offered to substitute it on two different pizzas with sweet ham, that is, pizza carbonara without bacon. If I had known at the beginning I would have left the place. I do not recommend it, it was also of poor quality."
Ginos,"Tado was perfect except that once we took our order, it took them three hours to bring us the food. On the terrace the pigeons were in charge of cleaning the plates where the diners had already left."
Ginos,"Pizza tres moyenne et bcp d huile, pepsi au verre sans bulle et service moyen."
Ginos,Very good pizzas and desserts. Very cozy and quiet place
Ginos,"I ordered glovo, a carbonara and the bacon rolls and I got both things instead of bacon, sliced sweet ham together. Its embarrassing to be careful if you order delivery because since youre not physically there, they dont care what to wear."
Ginos,"4 of us went to dinner. Of the 5 things we ordered, 3 didnt fit, and they were also common things like provolone and bacon, when 90% of the dishes contained bacon... We had to end up eating things like carbonara with sweet ham to replace the bacon ...Also when ordering, they didnt even tell us about the dishes and ingredients they didnt have, they told us once they started bringing us things like drinks so we couldnt leave. Because if they had told us before that they didnt have half of the things I would have gone somewhere else, and it wasnt exactly cheap... In short, the only good thing was the decoration of the place."
Ginos,"The food is spectacular, we ordered a piemontese fonduta, a carpaccio, and a pizza, and everything was delicious, but if the food is good, the service from the waitress Noelia, who has been spectacular, attentive and makes you feel at home. Thank you very much for the food, the treatment and feeling protected and at home"
Ginos,Good attention from Katerine. Very good food
Ginos,
Ginos,"We have eaten very well and the treatment from the staff has been great. A good place if you want Italian food. The pizzas are very complete and baked in the oven, you can tell they are artisans. The pasta was also very delicious, they recommended the rigatonis with chorizo and mushrooms gratin in the oven and they did not disappoint us. Without a doubt a place to repeat."
Ginos,"Deplorable quality of food, service too slow.. we waited almost 45 minutes for the first dish NOTHING RECOMMENDED The restaurant was practically empty and there was the same problem of slowness at all the tables, with the offer that there is in other places we will certainly not return"
Ginos,"Rich and abundant dishes, excellent!! First class service, thank you"
Ginos,Waitresses need a good dose of motivation and proactivity!!!
Ginos,
Ginos,"We book online for lunch and when we get to the restaurant, they tell us that the system has failed and that they dont have internet reservations. They havent given us any solution. If they have an internet reservation service, they should serve it and if they dont want to serve it, close it. Terrible service!!!!"
Ginos,Thank you Kevin for an unparalleled experience!
Ginos,"I have been there several times for lunch or dinner. The food and the quality of the products is very good. The thin crust pizza and the spectacular provolone. In the summer they have a delicious sangria! The staff are very friendly and attentive, and the place looks very well maintained."
Ginos,"Spectacular!! To highlight the waitresses!! Veryyyyy good service, and I know what Im talking about, Ive worked in hospitality for 40 years!"
Ginos,"The food is good, the pasta is better than the pizza but for the price it is good. The pitiful service, half an hour between courses, to order a second drink too... with a practically empty terrace. we will not return"
Ginos,very slow waiters the service is horrible
Ginos,"After waiting more than 20 minutes for the waiter to serve us, she finally takes the order. Of the 2 dishes ordered, only one came that was unseasoned and without cheese even though it was stated in the ingredients. The second course never came even after asking the waiter and at the end of our disappointing experience they wanted to charge us for everything even though they never served us the second course. The waiters are too slow even though the restaurant was half empty, they are completely uninterested in the guests. Avoid this restaurant!"
Ginos,They took an hour to bring us the food. They didnt bring everything at once. Its been a disaster.
Ginos,"The horrible service, not because of the treatment of the waiters, but rather the one who manages the kitchen or shift. We were waiting for more than an hour with a reservation made, they served us out of time, the truth is that it is not the first time that this has happened to us, but the service was bad and not because of the treatment or capacity of the waiters, but because of not managing the number of people. people with the ability to cook, of course the same with the rest of the tables."
Ginos,"Awful. They dont have staff and they want to take on a lot of customers and they dont come, especially in the kitchen. It takes 1 hour to serve the first ones... fatal. They also do not have any details and do not even warn that there is a delay. If they had warned us we would not have been angry or perhaps we would not have even sat down."
Ginos,
Ginos,"The service is unfortunate, very slow and not very attentive to the customers, more than 20 minutes for a delicious chocolate and the same for the other dishes, IMPRESSIVE"
Ginos,For me its great it never disappoints
Ginos,Excellent service!
Ginos,Very very poor food all arrived at different times. Last meal to arrive was inedible so disappointed. Service was terrible had to go and request drinks to find all staff standing about on their phones or chatting.
Ginos,"Food is irregular, some good some bad. Service is abismal. Slow, uninterested, inattentive... Just terrible."
Ginos,"Outdoor, quiet environment. Friendly treatment. Vegetarian options: Tortellini stuffed with cheese with onions and different cheese sauce"
Ginos,"Quality of food is like in the near food court. Salad which go together with meat was not dressed, just greens from package. Garlic in potatoes was not noticeable, coffee was Gad station level despite the fact that place is  Italian . No recommend at all"
Ginos,Lemonade is undrinkable at all. Mediocre food and sauces are just tomato paste from the supermarket. Didnt like the whole experience.
Ginos,"The food is passable, the service regrettable, the restaurant was half empty and we waited 45 minutes for them to take our order and bring us the dishes..."
Ginos,"I only went to make a claim, they have the balloon service and our order never reached us but they did charge us the amount, according to them the Rider took it and did not return it to the store, we did not even receive a call to check that they were in the right place, they simply walked past us and left, we were left without dinner and without the money we paid, apart from ruining our night, according to them they had no way of contacting either the Rider or the company they have contracted to do home service for them, everything is surreal, anyway...dont wait for us, the complaint continues its course to both Ginos and Glovo"
Ginos,"Great experience. It took them almost half an hour to serve us and after a long wait they brought only a couple of dishes. They never served the drinks. Of the dishes they brought, all were bad. After another long wait to correct the dishes, I am still waiting for my food to be brought to me which never arrived. I do not recommend at all"
Ginos,"Vegetarian options: Its very bad, it has a lot of salt, it doesnt have pallio, its just that my potato is not cooked"
Ginos,"The food is delicious, and they have gluten-free options. The bad thing in our case was that the service took a long time to serve the tables. We were waiting almost 20 minutes after we finished eating the main dishes and they came to take the plates and take our order of the desserts. The place was quite full but perhaps there were few staff to serve, they seemed a little rushed."
Ginos,
Ginos,"Excellent service, Kevin very nice. We were a group of 8"
Ginos,The baddest and most expensive Caesar salad of my life. There is no photo because it wasnt worth it. Expensive and bad. Im not coming back.
Ginos,"We went at 7:00 p.m. and it was closed when it says it doesnt close, they should update the hours"
Ginos,We decided to eat here as it was very quiet and offered vegetarian options. They initially refused to seat us they said they had no tables even though they had plenty of visible empty tables inside and outside the restaurant. Eventually they seated us but the staff were not helpful and took ages to take our order and came across rude. Would not recommend definitely felt the discrimination!
Ginos,"There is really very bad organization, they should see the order of customers entry since they have delivered the food to five tables before ours and we told them that we were in a hurry so I dont understand how or why they dont follow the order other than that they made a mistake with drinks. They are very slow and do not follow the order, we waited an hour and then they gave it to us to take away, in short, a complete disaster"
Ginos,Very good treatment from Alicia in Diagonal Mar
Ginos,"KE?  4 a water? We are crazy? Maybe this is an obituary and not a review, because come on, Im dropping dead."
Ginos,Liked the food. Excellent service
Ginos,"The food was delicious, both pasta, pizza and desserts."
Ginos,"The attention leaves a lot to be desired, they take a long time to seat you at the table and when they seat you they serve you in sections, they forget things and leave you unattended for quite a while. The waiters are lost and the food is cold."
Ginos,Had to wait a very long time for 2 pepperoni salami pizzas. One pizza came first and the other after 20 minutes. Way too much oil and very limp pizza. The taste wasnt good either.
Ginos,"We assumed that the food was edible and decided to eat here. After the waiter named  Kevin  was ready to take our order after failed attempts, we ordered and waited...and waited. When the sangria finally came, no glasses were brought to the table, whereupon we were given dirty glasses when we asked. The food arrived for 2 people but we were just 5 people, polite as we are, we waited for the remaining dishes... the minutes passed and when 2 more dishes were brought to the table, the first two had already cooled down. When the last dish didnt come after another 15 minutes, we asked the incompetent waiter Kevin for the bill for the drinks and wanted to speak to the manager, whereupon everyone just giggled and pointed to the equally incompetent waitress next to him and claimed that she was the manager . It was too stupid for us and we left the restaurant with the bottle of wine we had paid for. 0/5 stars audacity"
Ginos,"Food was delayed, glasses were forgotten and the dishes themselves were not clean. No recommendation"
Ginos,"The glasses were dirty as were the plates. One out of 5 people didnt get their food and it was completely forgotten. The manager couldnt speak English. Service 1 star is still too nice, I cant rate the food"
Ginos,Alicia has treated us wonderfully in addition to the food being delicious as always. We will return without a doubt
Ginos,Literally have Never seen slower/more incompetent staff in my life. Just pick any other place.
Ginos,"For the time when we are quite hot inside the premises, otherwise fast clean service, very friendly staff, Thank you!!!"
Ginos,"Food was excellent, except the burrata which was frozen. Waiters seem to be lost, so the service was far from the best."
Ginos,"FETTUCCINE TARTUFO AND UOVO with little taste, the rest of the table was happy. The service is very new and despite not having much work we had to ask for the account three times. The place is pleasant and well decorated, now the doors are open and several pigeons have entered, and with the consequent loss of air conditioning, which is prohibited by law..."
Ginos,"We made a complaint about the lack of desire to work, the lack of empathy and the lack of professionalism of the waiters who were providing the service. They dont know how to serve the public and you can expect long waits between courses while you watch them having fun. Shameful. If they want to close the business, they are on the right track."
Ginos,
Ginos,"The place is cool, inside the Las Glories shopping center, even though you enter from the street on Diagonal. Our waiter Aaron was very friendly and pleasant, appreciated. The food was good, but it seemed a little lacking to me... for my taste, the bread with scamorza and even the pizza were missing a lot of cheese, but everything was very good in taste. The price is not cheap, but since we had a 2-for-1 movie ticket it worked out very well for us. Have I helped you with my comment?"
Ginos,"I ate a pizza carbonara and scallops with linguini. The pizza was normal, the meat a little overcooked and the linguini a little bland. I was expecting a little more, but considering the price, its acceptable. The staff a bit slow and distracted. Parking: The first 3 hours are free. Wheelchair accessibility: There is wheelchair access and adapted services."
Ginos,"The food was perfect  but the service was non existing, lacy and fumbeling young waitresses.."
Ginos,Food great service not so great
Ginos,"We went to eat on a family Sunday celebration, making a reservation in advance, and everything was great. They greeted us at the door, and although it took them a few minutes to serve us/give us our table, the treatment was ideal and once seated, all without complaint! Ginos in general are quality, you know what youre getting, and you know youre going to eat well. You have quite a variety of everything, so you could spend a month eating perfectly without getting bored, and the desserts are delicious (you always have to put the desserts somewhere, theres a reason for the famous dessert corner...)."
Ginos,Excellent ! Servi rapidement
Ginos,"We went to eat yesterday with the family. The food was good but having a reservation at 2:00 p.m., they seated us as soon as we arrived, but they didnt come to take our order (including drinks) until after 20 minutes. Despite this, the waiters service was good. Then it is true that the dishes came out quite quickly and were delicious."
Ginos,
Ginos,"Super slow, you ask for something and they dont remember. Filler drink not original bottle."
Ginos,"There is no lunch menu in summer. The pasta on the childrens menu is small in quantity with barely any sauce. The chocolate shake on the childrens menu is not a chocolate shake, but a chocolate milk (cocoolat type). The price does not correspond to the quality."
Ginos,
Ginos,Correct food but terrible service.
Ginos,Much better than I expected for a franchise. A very successful pizza. Highly recommended since you can find several in the city.
Ginos,"Slow service even though there were only 3 tables occupied , but i can deal with the time if you don t try and poison me with that pizza. Never again, and really don t recommend. Food"
Ginos,"Pizza Margarita in Spanish, when you say that you dont want mozzarella on it and assume that it has normal processed cheese (Gouda) on it...."
Ginos,"I have truly never tasted such horrible pesto. I do not know what happened. I had already been to the Urquinaona headquarters and it is totally different. Very bad experience, very inattentive waitresses except for the blonde, they did not give us cutlery and the place was almost empty. Fatal, we will not repeat it very surely"
Ginos,"Correct food in quantity and quality. Very slow service, they brought the food before the drink. Price of drinks expensive, a water 3.5. A rod 4.10"
Ginos,"Very careless service, apart from me, other tables have complained about the same thing before paying, not paying attention to the tables and on top of that the food is not up to the quality of what you pay for, hard pasta that you bite like gum (spaghetti) and the same amount, my son in his childrens menu had the same amount as mine....paying more per individual dish than per menu, I dont fly to this ginos anymore, there is nothing to say that no one has said to this restaurant since there are reviews of the same thing and complaints that I have seen in the same restaurant today, poor attendance and poor food quality... I do not recommend it as there are other restaurants similar to this one with better quality and price and better service at the table."
Ginos,They took a long time to serve the food
Ginos,"The service is extremely poor, slow and with constant mistakes. Some waiters dont know the location of the tables. The quality of the food does not match the price. They have a lot to improve, especially with the room team."
Ginos,
Ginos,Thank you Alicia for serving us so well and being a sweetheart.
Ginos,"Compared to other ginos this one has undoubtedly been worse. In terms of service, it took them a long time to seat us and it was not full. The food was practically cold when it was served to us and no one remembered to give us cutlery. It was easier to just get up and grab them myself. It is also worth noting that it is full of pigeon poop everywhere."
Ginos,"very good place to eat, the waitress alicia very nice"
Ginos,"I was brought there by a friend who had already been to Ginos from other places in Barcelona. From the beginning we already saw that the service was slow and, despite the fact that there were many empty tables, they did not wait to give us a table, but we decided to stay. They took our order and drinks. We had to remind them to bring us the drink after waiting 10 min. I wouldnt say that the food came out quickly, rather it took a little longer, but since they didnt bring the drinks, the wait was even longer. We couldnt take advantage of the refill as the staff were overwhelmed and the girl seems to have forgotten (she walked past us 4 times). Finally we asked for the bill and then he remembered the drink. At that point we just wanted to leave."
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"We got here right after landing in the city and were so happy that we chose this spot. We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere. We got the salad, the cod and two beers for starters and finished with a spectacular honey and onion pizza. Staff was lovely and the vibes were great."

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"Ambiance and staff very pleasant. Service a bit slow. I ordered Vitello tonnato, but had nothing to do with the original recipe. It was just  carpaccio with a bit of mayonnaise and tuna sauce, a bit disappointing. Also generally a bit pricey, but probably normal for the centre of Barcelona."
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"Very friendly, good wine list and dishes. The quality-price ratio could be improved, the ingredients and the size of the dishes do not justify the bill."

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),It is a luxury to always come to this restaurant. Exquisite treatment and always accurate recommendations. 3rd time here and the pastas always surprise us. The best Italian I have tried in Barcelona!
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),Awsome place. Vegetarian options: Burrata Food : 5/5 |
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"The restaurant is very nice and clean even though with little light it is a very romantic atmosphere, The food is tiny for the price, the ridiculous pizza looked like a toy because of how small it was, I repeat for the price I see it as super unfair, they had a good flavor but nothing out of this world, just like the risotto or the pasta, it was delicious but I have eaten better in other Italians and with more quantity quality price!! I left hungry."

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"We left the Picasso Museum, it was about 3 pm. We wandered the beautiful streets of the area, looking for a place to have lunch. It was a day covered by clouds that, a little later, would release a fine rain, which would finish off the bohemian atmosphere of that afternoon. We saw her fall through the glass of the window, while we were having lunch, very satisfied, in a cozy corner of the Bronzo. It was as if the restaurant had found us Very good attention and guidance, both in terms of wines and food. We really liked the place, the atmosphere, the Sicilian wine, the pasta, the risotto, the charcuterie and cheese board, the pizzettes, the anchovies with lemon butter, the affogato coffee... An afternoon and a Italian to remember and repeat. Thanks!"

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"I honestly dont understand why it doesnt already have 5 stars. It is one of my favorite restaurants. I havent tried a single thing that I dont like. The price matches the quality perfectly. The best of all is the light it has, which is adjustable and makes you feel like youre in a Woody Allen movie. It is one of the most romantic restaurants I know. My favorite dish is the rigatone with truffle, sausage and parmesan... And the best of all is the gorgonzola cake for dessert: the best cheesecake I have ever tasted, I could die eating it and I would feel like I was in heaven. Im not exaggerating. The incredible service."

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),A quality kitchen. The problem with the restaurant is that if there are many people it is impossible to have a clear conversation. Fast and friendly service
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"Good atmosphere, you feel at home"
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"There were 4 of us for dinner. The atmosphere and service excellent. It has the vibe of a small cozy place, everything taken care of with care and detail. The homemade focaccia is spectacular, served in paper bags and piping hot. Between rissoto, tagliatelle and gnocchi, gnocchi are undoubtedly the tastiest. I saw the portions smaller than normal. The attention very good."
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"We have had dinner at the restaurant and the pizzas are quite good but the price seemed expensive. On the other hand, we have asked for a detail to end the dinner and they have refused, also responding in a slightly arrogant way. This makes the venues score worse, and we do not recommend it."
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),SPECTACULAR !! Everything to lick your fingers!!
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),Spectacular
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"We went because it looked very good and had good reviews but we left disappointed. The place is cute but the food doesnt justify its price, we had a truffle pizza that tasted very strange and a carchofa pizza which we didnt even try because first they brought us another pizza and then when they brought us the good one, it was missing ingredients. Furthermore, we ordered a very boring straciattela for 14 euros and they brought us a bread, which they called  focaccia  but it was not even close and they charged us 5 euros for it. Anyway, if you like Italians, I dont recommend it at all. I hope this helps to improve the restairant because really to DRINK something is cute."
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"Venetian restaurant in the center of Barcelona. Some dishes that really surprised us. The quality is good. The most common are pizzettes and cheesecake, but the more atypical dishes are worth trying and getting advice from the waiters. Very attentive service."

The place is beautiful, intimate and well decorated. Very friendly service and very polite waitresses. Very good quality products.

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"We visited this Mediterranean restaurant in Barcelona enticed by enticing food photos, but our experience was far from satisfying. The bathroom resembled one from a questionable bar, the touted artesanal focaccia was dry and flavorless, the risotto resembled a lackluster Indian soup, and the wine, though average, lacked the courtesy of a tasting offer. The calzone left a disappointing taste   overall, not recommended."
Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"I cant comment on the food, but you cant trust reservations. You do it 4-5 days before and request the terrace under the cover, which they confirm. On the day of dinner you find a table in the middle of the sidewalk, uncovered. They comment on it and tell you  Im sorry, it is what it is.  We went to a nearby place where, without a reservation, we probably had a better dinner and without being cold."

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"We went to eat as a group of 9 people with 2 children. The food was delicious, the menu is very varied and the place is cozy. They offer a wide range of Italian products: sausages, cheeses, meats, pastas, pizzas, risottos, etc. The staff was very friendly and attentive to us. Please note: they do not have chairs for small children. The red shrimp risotto is spectacular. 100% recommendable."

Bronzo - Bar e cucina (Eixample),"Without a doubt, between the starters and the main ones, this time we are left with the starters: the vitello tonnato and the baccala mantecato. But if I had to choose one, I would choose the Baccala mantecato: very smooth and its citrus touches are surprising and very pleasant to the taste. For mains, this time, we ordered the baccala mantecato agnolotti, which on the contrary did not tell us much, and the porcini risotto and duck magret. For dessert we ordered the gorgonzola cheesecake, the meringata cake with limone and the tiramisu."

In addition, the service was great, always attentive and friendly. Bravo! And continue like this!"

The highlight of my meal was the Tagliata. The use of rosemary smoke added a wonderful fragrant touch to the high-quality beef, and it was cooked to perfection. Even the dessert was exceptional - a delightful combination of chocolate, olive oil, and a hint of salt for a perfectly balanced finale. This is a truly special dining experience that I highly recommend."

LOKAL BAR,"Came here our first night in Barcelona and we re very pleased! Service was lovely, food was excellent. Great tapas spot."
LOKAL BAR,"A restaurant that suits my taste and is my favorite restaurant in Barcelona. A bit expensive, but with so much meat, the price-performance ratio is not bad. Three drinks and four dishes for three people cost 32 euros per person. The steak is what everyone will order. I think it s okay. It would be better if the doneness was lower and thicker. (The boss didn t ask how well you want it, so I forgot to ask.) There are some green peppers in the middle, but it feels like it s a bit overcooked. , although the boss said it s totally fine to eat The pork knuckles are delicious, with a dry aroma but the meat is also very tender. The seasoning is good. It comes with potatoes and salad. It is filling. Smoked salmon is my love, raw food lovers can eat the whole plate The octopus is okay, but it looks like a pile of chili powder and it actually has no taste hahaha"
LOKAL BAR,"Tres bon, service sympa, pas cher,"

LOKAL BAR,Lokal Bar in Barcelona offers a quintessential experience that captures the vibrant spirit of the citys culinary scene.
LOKAL BAR,"Perfect place for dinner, we been there 3 times and all dishes has perfect taste"
LOKAL BAR,One of the most delightful places in Eixample. The staff was kind and generous with us as we stumbled our way in after a long flight. We loved it so much we came back with a reservation 3 days later. Tuesday is a treat in itself with a French Pianist who adds his own flair to familiar pieces. By far my favorite spot in Barcelona. Get the olive oil bread and ice cream. It will blow your mind.

LOKAL BAR,Amazing food and a great experience. Hostess was super positive and welcoming. Food
LOKAL BAR,"Lets just say that there is a reason for me to go all my way to find them and give them bad ratings after my visit to Barcelona. We found this place according to tasteatlas. It was a total disappointment. There were not many guests when we arrived, yet we were assigned to this small table that can barely fit two ppl. We ordered some beef burger which is way too cooked and dry. My husband cannot cut the burger because the table wobbles like crazy. I ordered octopus leg which is a tiny portion and overpriced."

LOKAL BAR,
LOKAL BAR,"Rapport qualite-prix desastreux, particulierement pour Barcelone. La cuisine nest pas mauvaise, mais pas exceptionnelle non plus - assez standard pour ce quon peut trouver a Barcelone. Le vrai probleme est le prix, deux fois plus cher quailleurs, pour des portions de nourriture deux fois inferieures a ce qui se fait ailleurs. Aussi, le temps de service etait tres long. Vraiment decevant a ce niveau. Concernant lambiance, il y avait de la musique live. En revanche je ne sais pas si le musicien etait un professionnel. En conclusion, la nourriture nest pas decevante, mais ni lambiance, ni le cadre, ni la qualite des plats ne justifient un tel pricing. Quand on affiche des prix au-dessus de la moyenne, il faut proposer une experience qui se distingue de la concurrence. Ca nest clairement pas le cas ici."
LOKAL BAR,"Nice, cozy atmosphere and delicious burgers."
LOKAL BAR,Great food !!!
LOKAL BAR,"If you enjoy great tapas with live music, look no more. The people here are super nice and the food is just as good. Try the aged beef with one of their tasty salads and thank me later"
LOKAL BAR,"Amazing restaurant, booked a table here based on the good reviews on Google and we were not dissapointed. Quite a spacious place where we had a nice quiet table at the back of the restaurant. Staff were super friendly and helpfull. Nice selection of tapas of which we tried quite a few dishes, all were delicious and perfect, but their best and most famous one is the aged beef tagliata, which they grill at the table. Crema Catalana and coffee tasted good as well and Im pretty sure that their Sangria is the best I ever had. 10/10 highly recommend this place."

LOKAL BAR,
LOKAL BAR,"The calamari and toasted bread were delicious, highly recommended, and the Spanish omelet tasted like curry, which was a bit surprise. Dessert is Catalan cream, which I think is average and has a strong eggy smell"
LOKAL BAR,"A promising restaurant where everything is served a la carte. The menu dishes are carefully selected, and each dish is delightful for the taste buds. The waiters are very helpful and attentive to the customers needs, and the owner works alongside them, which gives an added trust bonus. I recommend the beef steak and octopus on a bed of mashed potatoes; they are exceptional."
LOKAL BAR,"Very nice place, tasty tapas, super nice and attentive staff."
LOKAL BAR,We had an unpleasant experience here when I brought my nephew and a couple other people with me. We asked for a bottle of house red and the guy tried to tell me it was $25. That is pretty cheap everywhere else but not here is Spain but whatever. So he brought the wine. It was a $5 bottle That I would normally pay $15 for in a restaurant. The more I thought about it the more I wanted to find out what happened so we asked another waiter for the wine menu. That person said  ok  and went to get it. He came back and said they didn t have one. We were getting scammed. Then the waiter came to the table at the end and presented the credit card machine and ASKED me for a tip. Been in Spain eating out for three months and never ever been asked for a tip. We always leave one in cash (and it makes our Spanish friends unhappy) but it s hard for us not to leave one. This place or at least our short waiter with the poofie hair is a scammer.  The final thing was that out wine was not on the bill but the charge was on the credit card statement.

Summarizing Come! A ten, service, place and food!"
Sr. Ceviche,"Okay, but terribly expensive."
Sr. Ceviche,"The place is nice, the waiters are charming, but the food is not worth it, the ceviches are not authentic, because of the name of the place, I thought I was going to taste an authentic ceviche."

Sr. Ceviche,Food and cocktails were amazing. Staff were very friendly
Sr. Ceviche,Food is amazing yeah but brooo really expensive
Sr. Ceviche,Latin American food place with Latin American inflation. Between 23% and 35% increase in prices from 2023 to 2024. A place that was good becomes a place with high prices. Minimum  30 per person.

Sr. Ceviche,Brilliant. My Ecuadorian girlfriend said the food was like her grandmas food back home.
Sr. Ceviche,"Great service and vibe, but the ceviches are really small portions for the price and disappointing in terms of taste. The fish looked like defrozen industrial food. I would not recommend this place."

Sr. Ceviche,
Sr. Ceviche,"3 eme fois que nous y dinons. A chaque sejour a Barcelone, nous y allons. C est delicieux et le service est super !! Une adresse a conserver ;-)"

Sr. Ceviche,Great place with great atmosphere. The food is delicious and made with love. The service was beyond nice! Thank you for the good time!
Sr. Ceviche,I was very skeptical at first because I don t eat fish nor soups a lot. I was left astonished by how tasty everything was. The staff were also very nice and gave us plenty of explanations on what the food is and so on. I can say I was very happy with the place.
Sr. Ceviche,Its all very good!
Sr. Ceviche,"Du peps! Les produits travailles sont frais et de qualite. Les plats sont tres bien assaisonnes. En plus dun personnel  accueillant et detre un etablissement dog friendly, nous y avons passe un agreable moment ! Je recommande !"

Sr. Ceviche,Amazing food and cocktails. The pisco sour is something else!
Sr. Ceviche,"We were looking for something different to the traditional and oily Spanish tapas that we d been eating for the last couple of days and what a treat we found with Sr Ceviche. One of the best Peruvian restaurants we ve been to. Nicolas, Juli and Caro were absolute gems and recommended the best of the best from their menu. We recommend: the Pisco Sour, and all of their food!"
Sr. Ceviche,Nico and Juli took great care of us. Super delicious food!
Sr. Ceviche,"A 10 for Nicolas and Julian, very nice guys, their attention is fantastic"

Sr. Ceviche,"Julian and Nico, thank you for your presence!"
La Pala Pizza Bar,The pizza was weirdly crispy and covered in a thick layer of cheese. The only thing that tasted good was cheese. None of us ate it. It couldnt be digested even hours later. Nausea came at night.

La Pala Pizza Bar,What we liked most was the service. At all times they have treated us very well and have brought us some free slices of pizza because our order took a while. A detail that is not usual. We got a secluded table upstairs in a very charming little room. The menu is very complete and with a wide variety of pizzas. We ordered a shovel and it was very good. The quality-quantity-price ratio of 10! Highly recommended and we will surely return.

La Pala Pizza Bar,A little expensive for what you eat
La Pala Pizza Bar,"AMAZING restaurant! The pizzas were great, IMMENSE variety, large and served quickly. The pizza dough and focaccia were great."
La Pala Pizza Bar,Check before going if the kitchen is open. We have crossed half a city to get there and were told kitchen was closed.
La Pala Pizza Bar,"Its not worth it, its a touristy place like a house, the pizza couldnt even be considered good"
La Pala Pizza Bar,

La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,Amazing house vermouth!
La Pala Pizza Bar,Delicious!
La Pala Pizza Bar,"The food is amazing. We had a pizza Capricciosa and one La Paradiso. Both were delicious. As most of the restaurants in Barcelona,  this ones kitchen opens at 8 for dinner. We arrived around 7:30 and we ordered some dinks, the waiter told us that we could wait until 8, when we cand order. He came at 8 and said that we could order some starters if we wanted because they had to do the pozza for the counters first and then take the orders. He came back at 8:15 to take our order. Service was pretty fast after this. Definitely recommend, but keep in mind to go after 8 PM. Vegetarian options: They have various vegetarian options Dietary restrictions: The tomato sauce doesnt have black pepper There are pizzas that dont have cheese Wheelchair accessibility: Its on the ground floor"
La Pala Pizza Bar,"Amazing pizza! It s cheap, the dough and crust tastes great and the lasagne is really good too. Vegetarian options: Margarita pizza, white cheese pizza with mushrooms"
La Pala Pizza Bar,Best flatbred pizza in BCN. The lady you greeted us was extremly nice. I highly recommend visiting this establishment if youre in a moon for a quick bite or even Dinner.
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,"Roman style cut pizza. The dough is quite crispy and airy, the variety and quality of the ingredients is quite good. They also have whole pizzas and other types of dishes such as lasagna, focaccia and pasta. The place is small but cozy. A good place to eat quickly. Vegetarian options: They have some vegetarian and vegan dishes."
La Pala Pizza Bar,

La Pala Pizza Bar,We loved the service and the food was very good 5/5
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,A good restaurant to have a pizza after going to the Theatre
La Pala Pizza Bar,The pizza is super delicious! Crispy and tasty. Its a little strange that every time I come the waiters serve you chewing food and talk with their mouths full. Curious..
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,"I went with a friend to have dinner here and it was spectacular. The environment is good and calm. Attentive, fast and charming service. The pasta is exquisite, there is variety and I really liked the combinations. The dishes are normal, they are not just for tasting and they are not super generous to the point of exceeding them. The pasta is fresh and on the plate you can recognize the different flavors of the pasta, the sauce and the rest of the ingredients (vegetables, meat, etc.). They accompany it with a good powdered cheese and they also have a menu option that goes with focaccia and is economical."
La Pala Pizza Bar,"We were on the terrace, cheap but the tapas left a lot to be desired...the bravas and the chocos (which were rabas) were small in quantity. Well the truth is we wont repeat it."
La Pala Pizza Bar,"This pizzeria is really recommended! The food there is incredibly tasty and the prices are absolutely reasonable. Our recommendation: the lasagne menu for  11.90! It consists of a large portion of lasagne, 1 piece of pizza of your choice and 1 drink. Its quick and you dont have to wait long. The employees are very friendly and accommodating. The food tasted great. You can also just have 1 piece of pizza or order something from the menu. If we are in Barcelona again, we will definitely come back to this pizzeria. Vegetarian options: Many vegetarian dishes on the menu and also available in the display. From pizza, pasta, focaccia to a vegetarian lasagne with eggplant, there is a wide range of vegetarian dishes"
La Pala Pizza Bar,Just lovely great place
La Pala Pizza Bar,Great tasty roman pizza! Lovely and welcoming staff! Food
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,"We have ordered two pizzas to take away and we have not been able to finish them. The dough was thin, but hard and heavy, on top they had a very thick, salty and oily layer of cheese and there was almost no tomato sauce, even though it was one of the ingredients. Highly not recommended."
La Pala Pizza Bar,"To enjoy pizza and pasta I recommend it, very good place, I always visit it when I come to Barcelona."
La Pala Pizza Bar,10/10 Pizza by the slice or full pizzas Very reasonably priced Service was amazing
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,Very good pizzas and very friendly
La Pala Pizza Bar,"La Pala Pizza Bar is a good option to eat if you are in Poble Sec, they have a very varied Italian offering The food is good, it is not exceptional but still for the price it is well worth it, the dishes are abundant. The staff is absolutely loving, all the waiters welcomed us with a smile and great willingness. The place is very cozy, in short it is a very good option to consider if your budget is low. Vegetarian options: There are several options"
La Pala Pizza Bar,"A great surprise!!! We left the Condal theater without knowing where to go and when we passed by it seemed like a cozy place. I have to say that we didnt have high expectations but, surprise, everything was great!!! Roman style pizza on an 80cm shovel with a variety of tastes and flavors!!! Super attentive staff, as I said, a great discovery. We will return for sure!!!"
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,"Very economical weekend menu, very good food and very friendly treatment from the staff. They have a very cozy table upstairs for 6-8 people. I love it."
La Pala Pizza Bar,Very friendly but they dont attend to you or have the menu in Catalan. Very good La Pala pizza.
La Pala Pizza Bar,Small place decorated with a rustic atmosphere that makes it very cozy. We ordered the large pizza to share between 6. Its the size of a bakers shovel and you can combine it with 3 different flavors (there are endless varieties!). You are already cut into parts. The pizza was very good and original (especially the anchovy and tuna). The girl who serves you is very friendly. The option to share the large pizza comes out very well for the price. The only downside is that they dont serve you or have the menu in Catalan.
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,Great pizza!
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,Good pizza by the slice
La Pala Pizza Bar,Amazing food and service. I got a slice of pizza and then a margeita pizza all for about 11 Euros. I couldnt believe the quality for the price.
La Pala Pizza Bar,"Very good restaurant and spectacular and even cheap quality and price. The staff is very attentive and kind. They brought us some olives to snack on without having asked for them and they didnt charge us for them. In addition, two pizzas, one personalized, free olives courtesy of the staff, water, soft drink, coffee and tea, came to just  20 per person. I will definitely return. Dietary restrictions: I cant eat cows milk or beer, due to food intolerance. The service was very kind when explaining to me the ingredients of the pizza dough and that I could add whatever ingredients I wanted. And the pizza was delicious."
La Pala Pizza Bar,
La Pala Pizza Bar,"I admit, I am a food connoisseur, when I eat something that is brutal I get excited, about the flavor, the texture of the ingredients and above all about the well-made things. The truth is, I didnt know the place, my nephew took me yesterday and I was amazed at everything. the senses. The truth is I was lost when it came to ordering, but the great attention of the waiters and their patience make it very easy for you when choosing. Congratulations guys for your great work. Small place with tables for two people and some long tables for groups of 12 people or to share with other people. The food is brutal, we ordered Two menus One of Meat Lasagna + Slice of pizza to choose + Drink for only 11.90 The lasagna was spectacular with its fresh lasagna pasta and a soft Bolognese and very pleasant in the mouth, the pizza we ordered was the spicy chorizo tremendously good, the other menu was Eggplant Lasagna without meat was spectacular and the pizza I have to say was wonderful that it We ordered bacon and truffle. We also ordered two portions of Eggplant Ricotta and Pesto Pizza. This Pizza is Spectacular. I recommend it. To finish, we couldnt miss the Tiramisu, which they have in both the Original and the Pistachio, both of which are brutal. This place is AWESOME 100% RECOMMENDED CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ENTIRE LA PALA TEAM. Well, today 12-27-2023 Im back and they dont fail today we tried Spaghetti Carbonara with artichokes: Egg Parmesan Guanciale black pepper and Artichokes Followed by a delicious homemade tiramisu, amazing as always. The Guanciale in Spain better known as Pork Jowl."

Maramaia,Extraordinary experience and exceptional pizza... Top staff....
Maramaia,"We went to make a menu of pizza, drink and dessert. The pizzas are very very delicious, the perfect dough. Friendly and fast service. And for dessert, a SPECTACULAR tiramisu! Highly recommended"
Maramaia,"To be clear, the food was tasty. Good pizzas (not the best in Barca) with fresh flavours. Also good limoncello. But, the problem was the owner and the way he treated  his employees. Theres different ways to treat someone when they dont please you. I speak Spanish, Italian and English, so i understood everything what he said. His rude macho man attitude its very unpleasant for the atmosphere. The stuff looked uncomfortable working there."
Maramaia,"Very delicious pizza, amazing tiramisu!"
Maramaia,"What I want to say about this place is that it serves the most delicious pizza   Ive ever tried, without any exaggeration. I want to thank the chef    and his team for their hospitality. Its a small place, but with a big heart   . I wish them all the best and encourage everyone to visit."
Maramaia,"Today I ate at noon here. Very delicious food and excellent dessert. Very affordable prices. Lunch menu  12.5. The pizza, pasta and salads are very delicious. One detail....next door they have put a store for takeaway food. All very rich."

Maramaia,"The pizza is amazing, unbeatable. The owner is a genius, the cook is an artist and the waiter is a professional."
Maramaia,"Absolutely the best pizza and calzone I ate in Barcelona. They were delicious and fresh with perfect crust. They offered a glass of home-made limoncello at the end of the meal and I can honestly say it was the best limoncello I ever drank in my life. The balance of sweet and sour was just perfect. The owner is very friendly, service is helpful and fast. Cant recommend enough."
Maramaia,"Rest of the reviews might be fake! :D But this is an honest review! One of the best pizzas and calzones Ive had.  The crust of the calzone was perfect,  not too thick,  prefect filings. The pizza bases were soft,  you can taste the freshness of the ingredients, and finishing off with one of the most amazing in-house made lemoncello. The hosts were super friendly and accommodating,  even to an English only speaking Aussie.  Highly recommended!"
Maramaia,
Maramaia,"Delicious food, very good and very friendly service. Pets welcome :)"
Maramaia,"We just had dinner on the terrace. Just as they say in all the reviews, the pizzas are incredible. We sat at one table and he made us move to another. We sit on each other and he lifts us up to move the table. I couldnt have ordered the terrace sooner if it wasnt properly assembled. I finish dinner and go to the toilet and ask the guy with glasses for the bill. There was no one in the entire restaurant and he told me to go to the table and they would bring the bill to the table because I was very busy. Oh really??? Very serious and very unfriendly staff, really. And the truth is that we havent had much luck with the table next to us who have been smoking non-stop, they looked like a botafumeiro and while eating the pizza I swallowed all the smoke. And on top of that, they werent even having dinner. What I did like was the owners detail of going outside to see how the customers were doing. That is a good service, thank you Parking: There is no parking in the area"
Maramaia,The best Porcheta sandwich I have ever eaten in my life.
Maramaia,Real italian pizza with the best ingredients.

Maramaia,
Maramaia,"Outstanding pizza in a homey atmosphere. One pizza is certainly enough to share between two people, but everything was so good we re glad we have some leftovers after ordering a pizza each. I loved the prosciutto & fungi pizza. The staff is kind and helpful. Indoor seating is limited but you can call to make a reservation."
Maramaia,Disastrous service!
Maramaia,"Delicious food, fast and friendly, correct price Vegetarian options: Vegetarian pizzas Parking: Near"
Maramaia,The pizza was very good and Ana Maria seated us quickly and served us very very well!!!
Maramaia,Perfect food in a little corner restaurant! Pasta cooked to perfection. The place doesn t look much but the food is out of this world Food : 5/5
Maramaia,Great pizza.  The crust is perfect.  The dough is authentic.  The flour he uses is Italian.  I highly recommend.
Maramaia,"Undoubtedly one of the best pizzas eaten in Barcelona, and not the usual menu found around in the various pizzerias, but experimental combinations of ingredients used expertly. The plus is the environment, familiar, friendly, the owner Giovanni is a lovable person, funny and passionate about what he does, the waiter treated us in an exceptional way. Highly recommended!"
Maramaia,
Maramaia,"They have the best pizza we have ever eaten. Absolutely great and delicious. The owner really knows his stuff and you can watch him making the pizza. He is always in a good mood and the staff is super friendly and attentive. We can really recommend this restaurant. However, you should reserve seats because the restaurant is always very busy."
Maramaia,Great pizzas! Made in the typical oven. Very small place. I would return

Maramaia,"Authentic Italian pizzeria. The restaurant is very small but inside it is full of life, it is worth going in and letting yourself be advised by the cook and his wife, some great Italian food! We had carbonara, pasta amatriciana for the little one and a pizza and we loved everything. The pizza is authentic Italian, crispy dough and spongy edges, spectacular! The bread is also very good, made by themselves, and the desserts are homemade and also delicious. And the best, all at a popular price. It was a pleasure to have landed in this restaurant, we will definitely return!"

Maramaia,"Delicious pizzas, very friendly service. We got seats because we went very early but it is highly recommended to reserve because the place is very very small."
Maramaia,"After reading the other reviews I reserved this restaurant expecting a cosy Italian trattoria on a cold night. Walking in, it felt more like a kebab restaurant, no atmosphere, no decor. Waiter/owner was a bit arrogant, trying to be funny, mocking my accent, pizzas ok but I won t be back."
Maramaia,One of the best pizzas Ive had in Barcelona! It reminds you of Italy itself. The staff was very friendly! I totally recommend this place if you want to eat good pizzas. We will be back!

Maramaia,"Bery delicious pizza, and the more important is the adorable staff, really very kind chef, highly recommended"
Maramaia,Best pizza in Gracia!
KINO,"Really bad burguer, extremely dry. Expensive drinks. Something good about this place is the staff: really nice. Except the argetinian guy with a long beard, all the time looking at the people with an angry face and being impolite with everybody. Not recommended"
KINO,"Liked this place a lot, but yesterday saw how waiter with long beard was, hm, spraying pretty polite woman with detergent spray for cleaning tables, because she was asking for coins there, lol - crazy, to put spray on human opposite of people even if she was asking for something - just impossible, not first time had in situation that staff there thinking that it s the  middle of the world  and everyone will like this place forever just because of location lol, not sure it will go this way"
KINO,"I dropped a whole beer, I asked for another, they brought me the bill and out of embarrassment, the waitress immediately hid it. Evidently they had charged me the 6 euros for the waste, they simply need more elegance in the service."
KINO,
KINO,
KINO,"A lot of noise, very high prices and unprofessional service."

KINO,"Dear Kino Barcelona! Thank you for your wonderful service and kindness over the past 3 days Fernanda and Ivan, we especially thank you for your attention and excellent service Lots of kisses Noel & Dani & Gagesz from Budapest"

KINO,
KINO,
KINO,Everything was perfect!
KINO,"Unfortunately we did not have a good experience or good treatment from the waiters. Anyway, typical, this is Barcelona. There were two of us and we wanted to sit and we clearly said that we would have something while we waited for three more friends to eat. While we were ordering beers, they approached us to ask if we were going to order or if they were going to agree, and we told them that it would take a while longer, about half an hour, to which the waitresss disgusted face was quite unpleasant, there are ways...no We started to make them uncomfortable and with a lot of pressure so we decided to order to eat ourselves, so that they wouldnt feel like they were wasting the table, and then a waiter came, picked up several chairs, lifted them up and told us, Im sorry but Im sorry. I have to take them, and we look like, is this real? We told him well if you take them we wont pay you what we just asked for since we will have to leave, and there he left them on the floor and left... very uncomfortable. At that moment we told our friends who were already grabbing a taco to arrive early, to order and we passed them the letter in a photo, so we ordered their meals... Well, the discomfort and stress was real. Then they let us know that if the third friend didnt arrive, they would take the chair, all very unpleasant. Finally our friends arrived, we ate, and there they changed their faces and were so happy, but we had the worst service in Barcelona in a long time, and look how difficult it is."
KINO,"Really enjoyed this place. Went with a group of 10 and a set menu - tasty, well-priced & fast, friendly service. Vegetarian options: Basic but great."
KINO,"Delicious food in a nice, relaxed atmosphere. Inexpensive!"
KINO,
KINO,
KINO,"Terrible service. They had unoccupied tables outside and they only let me sit at them if I shared with other people (place policy, according to what they said) and since people did not want to share it I had to eat, a brunch with a coffee, inside the place where there was a lot of noise and it was disgusting. Meanwhile, other people were sitting on the terrace without sharing a table and just having a drink. They took away my cup and saucer, almost without letting me finish. I repeat, when we arrived, the place was empty and so was the terrace. At the time of paying I told them that there were tables with only one person and they acted surprised."
KINO,
KINO,

KINO,"The workers really seemed like they enjoyed their job! They were dancing and singing to the music, and seemed down to earth! Very nice people, very good food!"
KINO,100/100 thanks to Gaia and Federica!
KINO,"Next to the museum, we decided to stay and we loved it, the food was very good and the staff was incredible."
KINO,"Every time it is super at Kino! The whole stuff is amazing, Federica the owner made us feel like home. The service was very good, the food evenly good. It is a gem to go to every time we pass by Raval, we love it. Staying in the terrace it is as amazing as to stay inside. We will be back again, and again, and again! Great work"
KINO,Great cocktails and ambient
KINO,Amazing food and chill vibes - loved it :)

KINO,"We have celebrated a birthday there for 19,383 people and the treatment and service has been spectacular. Thank you for everything you have done 10."
KINO,"Terrible service. Typical place where you cant even order a coffee unless you order food at the same time (which is not allowed but is a known practice in Barcelona). Its a shame that the food, although expensive for what it is, is good."
KINO,
KINO,Great student cafe! Friendly and fast service!
KINO,"You can see love in the dishes and in the service, the food is homemade and of very good quality. The experience was wonderful and so was the presentation of the dishes and the quantity."
KINO,After traveling over a week solo in Europe I was starting to get a little homesick. I went in here and saw a few american things on the menu (cheeseburgers and such) and lots of spanish dishes. If I wasn t feeling a little under the weather I would of gotten a cocktail but I stuck with beer. My service was amazing from the moment I walked in. Everyone was kind and the food was amazing and quick. I am only here for a few days but maybe I ll have time to come back. Highly recommend the brie tapas.
KINO,"Above all, excellent service!!! Whenever I come alone or with someone I feel at home. Apart from the breakfasts and the food in general, it is of very good quality. My friend Dave and I appreciate the treatment and affection we receive whenever we come. Thank you!!! Recommended 100%"

KINO,"Overall, the place is clearly overrated. The food is average, as is the service... in the warm season the room is hot and stuffy, and on the terrace... and like everyone else, the tables are small, there are few of them shaky and they are all occupied. Everything in the room is shabby, and how could there be no seats opposite the kitchen :)."
KINO,
KINO,"Fantastic food!! Generous portions, fair prices"
KINO,
KINO,
KINO,A place to drink and snack!
KINO,"I arrived here doing the Camino de Santiago, I arrived married and thirsty, thanks to the fact that Cristian helped me and gave me a very powerful mango mojito and thanks to that, I continued my way, I arrived in Santiago, I kissed the foot of the saint and I continued walking until I found a rave where I kissed everything I could. 100 people, a good place to drink and keep walking"
KINO,I know this place for many years but they changed the menu and the food was very disapointing! I paid for something i couldnt eat  the taste was horrible
KINO,Very very good everything
KINO,Good and clear selection of delicious food. I can recommend the hamburger and Caesar salad. The food was prepared quickly and was delicious. The staff was very friendly. A bit noisy in the evenings as there is a skater meeting point nearby.
KINO,"Super tasty food, nice but busy atmosphere! Service was very friendly!"
KINO,Love it! Must visit

KINO,"Hungarian / English below They speak English. Kind, fast, professional service. It is an easily accessible place. Young design, fits next to the skateboard track, where there is a lot of traffic. The place is wallet-friendly in terms of value for money. You can find everything from non-alcoholic drinks to alcoholic drinks. Tapas are divine, we were lucky enough to taste the mushroom and ham croquettes. We also ate Bravas, which was particularly light and pleasant for two people. Dog friendly, the entrance is equipped with a drinker. Its a busy place, but it has a pleasant atmosphere, except for the noise coming from the skateboard track. It is also worth trying with a group of friends.

KINO,"Had dinner and drinks outside on the terrace on Friday evening. Breakdancers and skateboarders on the square. Very good, nice atmosphere there!"
KINO,Il faisait chaud et nous voulions prendre un verre entre amis quand la serveuse blonde nous a regarde dun air hautain et a engeule mon ami. La sympathie clientele est a revoir !
KINO,Service extremement desagreable. Nous etions 7 amis a vouloir se mettre en terrasse (ou il n y avait pas plus que deux clients) et il etait inconcevable de pouvoir se mettre a la meme table en en collant deux. La totalite de cette courte experience etait litteralement nulle a cause de leur service de raciste. Ils sont tellement racistes.
KINO,"We loved the place. Modern and very adapted food whether you are celiac or vegetarian/vegan. The place is very well decorated and has a great atmosphere; The waiters are super nice. We ordered something to snack on and we liked it a lot; the bravas are super recommended!! As for the price, quite good and good product quality. We will be back."
KINO,Best Patatas Bravas in Barcelona.

KINO,Great feed
Koh,Brief but very accurate letter. We loved the sea bass and the eggplant
Koh,"The best restaurant I have tried recently, both in service and in general quality of the food. It is well worth the visit, to try very delicious food and surprising combinations."
Koh,"Un endroit tres agreable et accueillant, toute lequipe est tres aimable et disponible, et les plats sont varies et savoureux. Cest la troisieme fois que je viens et ce ne sera pas la derniere :)"
Koh,Outstanding. Unique. Fantastic fun place and premium quality.
Koh,"Great service, cozy atmosphere, exquisite food, quality and correct price."
Koh,It is not so delicious nor is the atmosphere so special. Overrated. Disproportionate prices.
Koh,"No complaints about the food. The service is something else; We were eating with 3 friends and at the end they offered us some shots which we accepted, then we had the coffee and the bill... So far so good. We pay the bill and they offer us some shots again (we had paid for the first ones on the bill), and when we are about to leave, they tell us that we owe the last shots, and despite the owner himself agreeing with me, because the last ones They offered them after we had paid, even though they agreed with us, they were so ridiculous to charge them... We will not return."
Koh,Very good place to eat. Some portions small for the price and some generous. In the end a little less than  40/person. X repeat if you want to eat well and calmly
Koh,"just got back from dinner at koh. SO SO delicious, loved every one of the 5 dishes we had. especially the glazed porc ribs (photo), simply WOW. absolutely recommended! Food : 5/5 |"
Koh,Asian-Mediterranean fusion cuisine. Dishes made with incredible flavors. Good treatment from the staff. A VERY top place to eat in Barcelona!
Koh,"brutal One of the best places Ive been to lately. Brutal katsu, spectacular miso eggplant and finger-licking nigiri!"
Koh,Very good and elaborate food!
Koh,"Very good service, the food is exquisite. To repeat many times :)"

Koh,
Koh,"The food is very delicious, but I dont think the price corresponds. The dishes offered for several people are not enough. In the end everything was delicious but we were all hungry."
Koh,A pleasant surprise
Koh,"Very good experience. Food is asian fusion style, combines characteristics of several asian cuisines. Owner was on duty and we learned that KOh means island in Tai."
Koh,"It was a fantastic evening. From the beginning to the end, everything was shot. The food was delicious and we were pleasantly surprised as the lunch progressed. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
Koh,"Incredible and fun restaurant. The food is very unique and delicious. Perfect service, friendly and very attentive. Super highly recommended."
Koh,The best food in Barcelona! Good people love from audiostack
Koh,First time in my life I ve been blown away by the food. A place with a unique character
Koh,
Koh,"We had dinner a couple of days ago and were pleasantly surprised. The food is a mix of Asian, Peruvian and Arabic cuisine. A risky proposal, different, but with a very good result."
Koh,"The food is delicious, the service is first class and the dishes are handmade.... A pleasure to eat at this restaurant"
Koh,
Koh,Great service and attention in an incredible restaurant. The quality of the food is really good and varied. Everything was absolutely delicious. They have wines by the glass and of very good quality!
Koh,Delicious! Very good cuisine and very friendly service. Relaxed atmosphere.
Koh,Theyve already beaten me to Punk IPA on tap
Koh,
Koh,"Soooooooooo good! You have to try it. Amazingly creative and delicious dishes, great energy, perfect atmosphere, awesome design. Really recommended."
Koh,"Brushes of flavor fusion, strong dishes, in a distinguished, elegant, but familiar environment. Three people serving, attentive and welcoming, who make you enjoy the experience even more. The old Casa Garcia, where my grandfather had accompanied me so many times, is now a piece of the new Poble Nou that we love to visit so much. Thanks for a great time, see you again..."
Koh,The food was very nice and the staff is really friendly. I was solo and they made me feel welcome.
Koh,"A great surprise. Nice place, friendly service and great cuisine. Without a doubt a place to repeat and recommend. Kid-friendliness: Very attentive with children, they can prepare a special dish for them"
Koh,Horrible treatment
Koh,Spectacular. Fusion that leaves you speechless. Its worth what it costs. A pearl to visit if Asian things are your thing. We will be back. Vegetarian options: They have vegan and vegetarian versions of the dishes. Dietary restrictions: They tell you well if you have any allergies
Koh,"Highly recommendable!! So delicious, as well as charming place"
Koh,"Very cozy space with a warm atmosphere, friendly and efficient service (with Quiques drive), along with very well prepared dishes with very successful and special flavors and textures. Essentials: Katsu Ceviche Bass Rib pita Among others .... Highly recommended."
Koh,A beautiful place with spectacular food
Koh,
Koh,
Koh,"Everything is spectacular! All dishes excellent, and very even!"
Koh,"Good food with flavors very different from what we are used to. It can be an interesting option but it is not cheap and they serve not very generous portions, so you can end up paying a lot and go hungry."
Koh,"A beautiful decorated place with an appetizing menu that has honestly disappointed me because of its taste. (very seasoned and fatty, not fine for my expectations) I think the service indicated more quantity than normal and well, its a shame that there was so much food. High price for the quality of the dishes"
Koh,Everything is great. The best: the falafel and bacon okonomiyaki!!! 10/10
Koh,"A restaurant with many dishes that surprise you, the flavors are exceptional and the service is very correct. We ordered quite a few small dishes to share and the truth is that we all enjoyed them. I think what surprised me most were the oysters with that miso and chilli broth, it was brutal, and the eggplant. The salmon tartare my favorite. The price is a little expensive, but going once in a while is very correct !"
Koh,
Koh,Exotic flavors very well combined. A feast for the palate!
Koh,"Friendly attention but not very professional. They treated us strangely for not having a table reservation, for ordering the dishes at different times, for complaining about the lack of a napkin, for asking about the lack of mango in the Thai mango salad. Anyway, not costumer oriented. Dietary restrictions: You have to ask which dishes are gluten-free"
Koh,"I think the same as in Karims review, it is a place I would not return to... Disproportionate quality-price although the decoration of the place is very cool."
Koh,"Poor rich!! They recommended the place to us and the truth is that we didnt like it at all. Very expensive for what it was... It is true that the place has a lot of charm and has its own signed crockery. We also liked the decoration a lot. They recommended we order six dishes and the truth is that it was too much food. We asked if they could cancel the last one and he told us that it was almost ready, but it took a long time and it was our dessert. It is not a place to repeat."
Koh,Delicious meats! Very original dishes. Very attentive service. Lemonade a success. The tableware is very special and provides a very sensory touch. We will be back!
Koh,"The service is friendly and helpful, although the dishes took quite a while, they were good, and the wine selection is correct. The place is well worked. I personally think that the dishes are very expensive. I will go back, but only for special occasions."
Koh,great service and attention in an amazing restaurant. quality of food is really good and variety. the miso eggplant is something else. coming back soon!
Koh,
Koh,
Koh,"This restaurant has been a great discovery, you can tell that there is care with effort in the experience they offer you. The food is exotic and very good. The service must be highlighted, it is excellent, they looked after us very well. The price you pay is right for the food, service and atmosphere. Well be back."
Koh,"Very good food, original and well prepared. The place is very cozy, and the staff advises you and explains about the dishes. He is very friendly!! Highly recommended!!"
Koh,Food: Price : Location: Amazing fusion-Asian restaurant. I recommend the Curvina al Curry and the fried Korean chicken. Amazing experience and service the stuff was great and the music   was lovely Highly recommended
Koh,"Good service and nice decoration. The food  somewhat pretentious and very expensive. Maybe we didnt get what we ordered right... but more than  80 for two people to have a few small plates for dinner and were left hungry... but I repeat, good attention and service from the staff :)"
Koh,"Really wonderful dining experience.   The food is unique and very tasty!   Reasonable prices and portions.  And the owner was very kind and personable, answering all of our questions.   Highly recommend!"
Koh,Really a place with a soul. And the food is tasty. Try the tasty tapas - won t be disappointed
Koh,Amazing food!
Koh,There is nothing in Catalan. They are a business that contributes to the marginalization of Catalan.
Koh,One of the best gastronomic experiences I ever had in Barcelona!
Koh,"A great discovery! It completely exceeded my expectations. Creative dishes, with delicious Asian flavors. The Banh Mi is spectacular, it is the richest I have eaten outside of Vietnam so far, 1000% recommended, it stole the show  . Photos: Salmon ceviche, edamame hummus and delicious mango salad. We will return for sure!"
Koh,"I loved it, it was a very pleasant surprise!"
Koh,Everything exquisite. I found everything very delicious and very well seasoned. It combines the Asian style very well. We loved everything we tried and the service is great too. Perhaps the menu of main dishes is somewhat reduced but there is a lot of choice thanks to the dishes that are delicious. I definitely recommend it.
Koh,yummyyyy
Koh,"Good place to have dinner and try different very good Asian dishes. The place is well decorated, the terrace a little poor, but the street does not give much more as it is too busy."
Koh,
Koh,
Koh,"Just a few meals, good for sharing. Not my style but loved by many."
Koh,Delicious food. Highly recommended.
Koh,
Koh,"The meal was nice, but the portions were very small for the price point. I left dinner hungry, and it wasnt cheap. Vegetarian options: There were plenty of vegetarian options on the menu, and they are very willing to adjust many dishes to make them vegetarian or vegan. Dietary restrictions: The waiter easily accomodated several dishes for our group, which had members who didnt eat pork meat and some who are pescatarians. Wheelchair accessibility: The access to the restaurant has no impediment to a wheelchar, and the door is wide."
Koh,"Despite the excellent service and pleasant atmosphere, the food leaves much to be desired. Many dishes were too salty"
Koh,
Koh,"Very tasty and original food, the flavors and combinations achieved, good service and attention."
Koh,
Koh,
Koh,The food is incredible and every dish is so diffrent but so good honestly recommend
Koh,"A very pleasant space with a lot of aesthetics! The food is very well made with a lot of flavour, creativity and enthusiasm!"
Koh,A place that leaves you fascinated! I have a terrible desire to go back and try more things.
Koh,
Koh,Fantastic! Highly recommended.
Koh,"Excellent place. Everything was delicious, the tiradito, the Thai salad, the sauteed loin and the lamb banh me. The desserts, the blackberry sorbet with lime zest and the cheesecake, were also delicious. The super cute atmosphere, retro music at the right volume. Super friendly service. Price according to quality. I was looking forward to trying the sea bass, we will return!"
Koh,"Love the good, drinks, ambiance, service!!!!"
Koh,Spectacular
Koh,I am a huge asian food fan and my first experience here was totally worth it! The thai salad is just amazing and they easily (and friendly) adapt to vegetarian option. Totally worth it place
Koh,"Delicious dishes, surprising and very pleasant combinations. Dishes that fall in love at sight and that make you go crazy when you taste them. A very welcoming place and very attentive and professional staff."
Koh,It looks like a Shushi restaurant but its a completely differerent concept that mixes different styles. The service is great and the food even better. Food
Koh,
Koh,"Wonderful food and service. Had a wonderful evening and loved every small detail in all the dishes, even Thai Salad was exceptional.  One minor letdown - Katsu Sando was a little bit dry and a level lower than all other dishes I tried. Food - Service - wonderful Sitting - wonderful Prices - 2 person dinner with drinks ~70 eur"
Koh,Delicious food and excellent service!

In addition to the local specialties, you can also enjoy excellent pizza thanks to Marco. After a long walk on the Rambla, a stop at Listo is a must. Absolutely worth trying also because it is very well connected and can be easily reached by public transport."

Listo,Worst pizza ever!
Listo,"We ate an excellent Margherita pizza and some spectacular Tapas here!!! The staff is young and kind, we will definitely return! Highly recommended!!!! We went to this place after walking on the Ramblas (dont stop in those little places that have all pre-cooked food and excessive prices) and then immediately after heading towards the port to view the aquarium! So the place is perfect, quiet and also close to Montjuik."
Listo,"En partance pour Majorque, nous avons cherche un restaurant a proximite du Port. Nous avons eu un accueil formidable,  la cuisine etait tres bonne et le service parfait.  Merci a Anthony pour son accueil et ses conseils,  si vous etes a proximite du port, ne cherchez plus !"
Listo,
Listo,"I came for lunch with two friends who arrived from Italy for holiday, and I couldnt have made a better choice. Here on the list the food is stellar. The pizza, the old fashioned way, large and with a super soft dough. the first courses (we took a meat carpaccio, risotto and salmon tartare) were delicious! The price is the best surprise! definitely low for the quality of the food! A restaurant to return to without a doubt and to recommend to anyone who wants to eat in an Italian restaurant worthy of its name! Congratulations to the LISTO staff!"
Listo,Excellent restaurant with Italian food and excellent value for money. Very polite and professional waiters. Wide choice of a la carte and daily menus. Highly recommended

Listo,"Very cool atmosphere inside and out. I ate on the terrace, which is very spacious, great food!!!! I loved the pizza, very tasty, the pasta with burrata and the hamburger, all delicious!!! And also the price is super good considering that the products are Italian and of high quality. Optimal for lunch, with a midday menu at  11 or so, Im sure there is nothing similar with this quality in Barcelona. Vote 10."
Listo,"Without words . 10 and praise Ive been back to Barcelona four times to visit relatives and every time I go back the Listo is now a fixed stop... Ive been around various places but no place like this one makes the local cuisine count and not only... phenomenal Neapolitan pizza and Italian cuisine top marks... kind staff always available, very large room and always kept clean.... For anyone who has the opportunity to find themselves in these parts, I recommend stopping by here..."
Listo,
Listo,
Listo,
Listo,Bad service!!!
Listo,"If you happen to be in Barcelona, an obligatory stop, super good pizza, Marco is a true master, super product quality, a real Neapolitan pizza, in my personal top 5 (Ive also been to the sacred monsters) this one plays great! Simone, co-owner together with Marco, makes you feel at home, a piece of Italian style that I like abroad, keep it up, it will be a nice point of reference for us! Greetings from Nicola Silvia and little Martina!"
Listo,The exquisite pizzas
Listo,"We arrived without a reservation at 9:30 p.m. There were people but the owner found a place for us, they had recommended this restaurant to us since we are Italian and quite demanding with food, well the truth is that I try 10, food 10, very nice and well-kept place in each particular. The enrrantes are super delicious, the fried foods are very crispy and you can tell that all the products are fresh. The area is very good, it can be easily reached by bus, metro or also on foot as it has a nice promenade next to the sea. Recommended"
Listo,Delicious pizza!
Listo,"Pretty mediocre food. The Andalusian-style squid are a real disappointment, they are not squid, they are little pieces of fried things, I dont know what they were, Im sorry I didnt take a photo so they could tell me what it was."
Listo,

Listo,
Listo,"I had been meaning to come to this restaurant for a long time and it did not disappoint me at all. I went to eat a lunch menu and in terms of quality-price it is one of the best in the city. First I ordered some chicken fingers with truffle sauce that were impressive, especially the sauce. For the second I ordered Pasta alla Genovese. This one was also very good. For dessert I tried the chocolate brownie. Besides, the staff is super friendly, attentive and professional. The views of the restaurant are very beautiful and the fact of being located where it is plays a very important role. I highly recommend it! Ill be back to order pizzas, which from what I saw at the other tables, Im sure theyre delicious!!"

Listo,
Listo,"A group of 35 people poorly attended. Two and a half hours of waiting, ridiculous portions, bread was ordered to somewhat mitigate the shortage, they charged about  50 for the supplement of poorly thawed bread. The insolent waitress Dominiq in a situation that she did not know how to manage when a member of the group wanted to pay to go out for air because she was not feeling well, she did not consent because she alone had to discuss the payment with the person in charge of the group. With an ironic smile he even said that I had disrespected him and pushed a falsehood. WE WILL NOT RETURN. Vegetarian options: I dont know Dietary restrictions: I dont know. Parking: I dont know Kid-friendliness: Yeah Wheelchair accessibility: I dont know"
Listo,Very good food at a good price
Listo,"If you can, dont go. Scarce and bad food. Extra portion of bread,  1.50. Very slow and rude service. As I said, I WILL NOT RETURN EVEN FOR FREE"
Listo,
Listo,"Super unfriendly staff bothers them when you ask them for something, it seems like they are doing you a favor, what can I say about the food that I have not eaten in a worse place, they say that the pizzas are homemade, they are of very poor quality, it seems that you are eating soft gum that They are and on top burned from below."
Listo,
Listo,"Nous sommes venus manger dans ce restaurant par hasard, beaucoup d attente pour dresser la table, serveuse pas agreable, et alors 20 euros pour une assiette de pates ridicule  la pizza n en parlons pas, sauce tomate industrielle et mozzarelle sans aucun gout ! Dommage le lieu est sympa sinon!"
Listo,Top pizzas and pasta. It shows that they work with quality products
Listo,Dominic the best
Listo,"We have been delighted with the quality of the product and the cuisine. The eggplant meatballs, fried squid, ham pizza and pasta are very good. We will return for sure."
Listo,"We went for dinner and the food was actually very delicious, but we arrived at 9:30 p.m. when the restaurant closed at 11:00 p.m. At all times we felt that the waitress wanted to kick us out and rush us when we were always willing to collaborate and hurry up to be able to have a good experience without extending the service schedule or anything like that. Also at one point, we tried to help her put the plates together and she secretly made a very bad face. We thought she was rude and had no desire to do her job. A shame because it is the second time we have gone and we liked it, and we will not repeat it because we felt very very uncomfortable with it."
Listo,"The  Menu Del Dia  was very nice, good options and the food was great. Service could be better, the guys seemed very stressed and running the whole time. I would come back tho!"
Listo,"Good food, fast service. Nice place overlooking the harbor. Its a pity that there is no lactose-free milk for coffee."
Listo,
Listo,We are in Barcelona but I felt like I was traveling through space to Naples. Spectacular pizza with light dough and quality ingredients. Nothing to complain about even the well-balanced and perfectly cooked pasta... The real plus? Eggplant parmigiana! Unmissable! Bon appetit friends!

Listo,"Found an Italian restaurant and pizzeria by chance, very courteous staff at the entrance, we take a look at the menu and immediately notice Italian products and very familiar combinations as we are Italians (Neapolitans). I chose a pizza with truffle burrata and provola cheese. After the pizza we meet the chef/owner also from Naples and we have a chat and to make you feel at home he offers us an excellent Kimbo coffee. I can guarantee if you are in Barcelona for a good pizza or Italian pasta it is the right place."
Listo,The tastiest pizza in Barcelona and beyond! Very low prices - pizza 10-14 I recommend!

Listo,The pizza is very good! There is an express menu (in August and Christmas they remove the menu - I dont know why...) and it includes a drink + pizza + dessert or coffee. The diavola pizza is recommended.

Buenas Migas,"Very good atmosphere, the manager is a very good person and very nice, I recommend it"
Buenas Migas,"Its not cheap, the place is nice, the service is correct, bordering on bland, the focaccias are nothing special for the price. And the spectacle of treating an employee badly is despicable. How is it possible that an employee is mistreated by a superior and the company does not respond. Be careful, with working there."
Buenas Migas,"I think they allow their workers to be harassed at work, washing their hands."
Buenas Migas,"The best chai latte with oats Ive ever had. They have all kinds of options to eat but if there is the option of vegetable focaccia it is recommended, very light."
Buenas Migas,"This place is perfect for eating and having a coffee, also for working!!! I ate a lasagna and I ordered a coffee and everything for less than 10 euros was very good  apart from that I dropped my coffee and they gave me another one, they were very generous  the service is really very good, thank you! Vegetarian options: They have different milk options and lots of healthy vegetarian food."

Buenas Migas,
Buenas Migas,The most delicious coffee in Barcelona Perfect for me Delicious focaccia and tiramisu. Friendly staff
Buenas Migas,We arrived very hungry and were dazzled by so many little things. Lucia greeted us with a smile and was very friendly. He answered all our questions and the best thing is that he treated us in a very very friendly way. We would eat again and greet her with great pleasure.

Buenas Migas,Good place to have a cup of coffee and grab a snack. Loved their ambience. Has good WiFi and plenty of power outlets if you need to work or study for a while. Their chairs and benches are not very comfortable but overall it is a nice place to hang out.
Buenas Migas,"They make a coffee with milk for  1.80, price according to the area, with fresh milk, VERY GOOD, you can see the quality of the product, creamy and intense at the same time. A 10. The entrance is a little dingy for my taste."
Buenas Migas,The chicken focaccia was delicious. Coffee was good as well. Nice outside space to enjoy the weather.
Buenas Migas,"Another place you don t want to have brunch at. Poor food, nearly no fresh juice, no smile. Find somewhere welcoming and fresh, you ll be better off."
Buenas Migas,"Very good place... the Bkenas Migas Chain in general. Ideal for working on the notebook, very quiet. And the food is very good. Very good service too"

Buenas Migas,"I found myself at home. All ready to delight the public and a magnificent and quiet place in case you need to connect and do some management. In fact during the morning I saw quite a few people studying and working. The food is delicious and the guy who makes the coffee knows how to make it. I think hes one of the few people Ive noticed that coffee really hits home. The people who attended to me spoke to me in Catalan, which is to be appreciated as I would say and I apologize if I am wrong about Argentina."
Buenas Migas,
Buenas Migas,"Jolly cafe/bistro at the border between Eixample and St.Gervasi. One of the cutest Buenas Migas of Barcelona, much better than the one of Barceloneta or Mallorca street. Very roomy dinning space and warm decoration based on pastel tones and some plants. Diverse array of focaccias, salty pies and cakes. Complete selection of hot beverages with vegan options. There are also many tables on the street. Vegetarian options: Possibility to choose oat milk instead of cow one for all the kinds of coffees."

Buenas Migas,Quiet place on a pedestrian street  Good selection of both sweet and savory products  great for breakfast or snacks  reasonable price-quality ratio for the area  Special mention for the staff. They are always super friendly :)
Buenas Migas,
Buenas Migas,"I havent tried the food but I was unlucky enough to apply to work here and the only thing they did was make fun of me because I didnt understand Catalan, and despite repeating on several occasions that I wasnt understanding them and that we should please communicate in Spanish, they continued to answer and ask questions in Catalan, without a response from me of course."

Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"I recently visited Narciso based on the promising reviews I found online, but my experience was far from satisfactory. First and foremost, upon arrival, I was told that the place was closed though online it said otherwise. The bartender insulted us, despite their website and other online platforms indicating otherwise. This lack of updated information is completely unacceptable and wasted both my time and effort. Furthermore, the lack of communication from the restaurants management regarding their closure is highly unprofessional. It reflects poorly on their commitment to customer service and leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of potential patrons. Overall, I would strongly advise against relying on any information provided by this place online, as it seems they cannot be trusted to keep their platforms updated with accurate details about their operating status. Save yourself the hassle and dine elsewhere."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Just don t, Unhappiness s allover the service counter bar!"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,We love this spot!! Always return while in Barcelona. Highly recommend it. Thank you Arlene!
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,The sandwich was one of the best Ive ever eaten and Arlenes service was incredible!

Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Nice place to share good italian tapas and wine.
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"The place is very nice, well attended. The coffee is delicious and the food is very delicious. But we had a 2 situation with friends, one in the living room and one in the bathroom. This message is for you to take that into account in order to provide better service and make people comfortable. Thank you"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"The service was very nice , the cheese was very good and the coffee good quality as well. However, I found two coaches in the restaurant. One in the area where we were eating and one that made me jumped in the restroom/ toilet area. I believe this is a very unsanitary issue that needs to be corrected as soon as possible."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Extra amazing and interesting cocktails!!
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Without exaggeration, by far one of the best sandwiches Ive ever eaten."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Put people to work. At 3pm you arrive and the girl says the kitchen is closed but the restaurant is open. Sandwich place. Pay someone else and work properly in a metropolis. Ill be back to try a simple sandwich today. The restaurant, according to Google, opens at 12 on Sundays and closes at 01:00. I get there at 3pm and guess what? Closed place, with the classic lazy Spanish that tells you, we are opening in 20 minutes, time to tidy up. Guys, you have acquired the Spanish style in all respects, disorganized, slow and listless staff, awkward hours and kitchens closed during lunch and dinner hours. In Italy it lasts 5 minutes like this and you should know it"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Cozy place delicious food!!!
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Very nice little restaurant. The food was very good, made in front of us. The staff were very welcoming and caring. The only slight difficulty was that the menu was only in Spanish and English, no French. We recommend !"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"EXCELLENT. A magical place in the heart of Born. Sandwiches with a kind of focaccia with quality sausages cut to order, delicious. Amazing Italian charcuterie boards too. Small place but a mandatory stop."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,The roast beef squash is excellent!
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"The discovery of Bar Narciso was a pleasant surprise during our dinner. Cozy and quiet place with good quality products and service. We opted for their crusty and artisanal bread sandwiches, generous in size, so sharing them is a good option to try variety We ordered The Colosseo, (pork cooked for 8 hours, accompanied by tomato and a creamy truffle) was an excellent choice and the Dolce Vita (Italian mortadella and pesto cream) and freshness and authentic flavor. In addition to their variety of cocktails, we decided to try the Aperol Spritz, which was simply delicious and complemented our dinner perfectly. In short, Bar Narciso has become an essential place to enjoy high-quality artisan sandwiches, a relaxed atmosphere and exceptional service. We will definitely return to continue exploring their delicious culinary offerings!"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Wonderful place to get a DELICIOUS panini. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was warm and cozy. I would definitely recommend come back!

Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Tres bonne adresse : la nourriture est de qualite et lambiance est conviviale !
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Excellent attention from Valentin and Cris! Exquisite food and tremendous presentation    thank you very much, I would return for sure just for them"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"I just wanna express the outrage as a local that lives in Barcelona and Narcisos have the nerve to charge me   6 for a warm glass of white wine. Valentin the guy behind the person was so inconsiderate and defensive, he didnt care at all how I felt.  he told me to talk to the owner about the  6 price for a  white wine by the glass instead of letting customers know how much their drinks really cost as they have no prices on their menu hanging at the door. Stay away at all costs . Zero recommendations."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"At lunchtime on a Saturday, the waiter was alone and decided to lock up  the kitchen.  He asks us to return 45 minutes later. After an hour, he tells us to wait 1 more hour. It is not even possible to evaluate the service since the bad behavior of the waiter has not served us food. We talked about sandwiches and cheese boards. You also dont need equipment for a 15m2 restaurant to cut slices of meat for bread. Update: the waiter did not report any errors and there was no noticeable effort in serving us or explaining himself. He only told us to wait 1 hour. And then 1 more hour."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Small but very cozy place. With outstanding Italian bites.
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Excellent food and service
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Tres bon sandwichs, service et ambiance sympa. Bon produits, frais, seul petit bemol sur le pain."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"A cozy place in the center of Barcelona to eat and snack on typical Italian-style sandwiches. I ordered the gioiosa and it was very delicious, you can tell that the products are fresh."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Great to eat schiacciata! If you dont know what it is, its a type of Italian panino, they cut the sausage and cheeses on the spot, which makes it fresher. The place is very cool, the staff is friendly and it is in the center, so ideal if you are passing through and looking for something to eat quickly. You dont need a reservation, there are usually a lot of people in the evening, having an aperitif"

Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Wish Id taken a better photo because those sandwiches were the best Ive ever tasted (veggi)! Delicious wine. Stumbled upon this tucked-away place on our first evening and returned the next day too. Recommended
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Very very small bar, you cant understand the lack of cleanliness and the apathy of its waiters. Only one brand of beer and on tap, the display case in which the food is displayed does not invite you to order it sincerely. Expensive and bad to avoid unless you are a clueless tourist."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"Lovely sandwiches, and nice wine by the glass."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"One of the best bocadillos in Barcelona   and we tried many places  ranked  higher! Unique, tasty, and super filling options on great quality pan. We had them made fresh in ~15 min and walked to Ciutadella to enjoy for a picnic. Highly recommend & worth the wait. Great service too. Note: The bar is very tiny so if you plan to enjoy food there, have a back up plan."
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,"We found it to be a brutal place to have a snack and some brutal sandwiches. The ingredients are of very good quality and the atmosphere is super alternative. They offer several types of Italian wines, cocktails and the bread with which they work. The sandwiches are impressive, they are super good, crunchy, soft, they are incredible!! In addition, the sandwiches are super abundant and they are super generous with the portions. It is a highly recommended place to go, especially with friends, to have a drink!!"
Narciso Restaurante Bar Born,Intimate and funny bar. Italian osteria style but with international service. I recommend to those who want to drink quality wines.

Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"Very few waiters for the people there are. I would tell the owner that with the people who pass by there and the prices he has, it is worth having so few staff. Also, we ordered some bravas to accompany the vermouth and they forgot to bring them, hey, were human, but not an apology. We told him that he no longer took them out and his response was oh okay. Its the first negative review Ive posted. Lets see if it helps the owner improve the service."

I asked for the letter and it took them 15 minutes to serve us because my mother-in-law got tired of waiting and came in to demand that they serve us. The nachos? Rancid. Their potatoes, nothing that isnt from any random store. The fried camembert? Well, it was like eating crunchy red fruit jam from the amount I had. Of course, it may work to fool tourists since they serve them quickly and well, but they abandon us Spaniards. Never to return. I am from the union and I have a lot of patience and I can be very understanding, but the service and food here are very very weak"
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,",,The food is good, the terrace is beautiful but what stands out the most is the professionalism and kindness of the Spanish girl who serves at the tables, always with a good attitude, a smile at the tables even if the place is full, see you soon"

Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,Perfect for the weekend vermouth in front of Sant Antoni!
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"Good quality food, and a very attentive and efficient service. Highly recommended for tapas in Barcelona"
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"Good lunch menu 15 euros Its not the best menu Ive tried in Barcelona but I must say it was good. The place is very nice, the location is good and it has a large terrace outside. The service was fast and pleasant. I dont like that they dont have prices on the menu but when making a menu it didnt affect me in any way. They gave us the option of ordering two pre-orders without making any complaints, even about removing the ham from the eggs. For all this my 5 stars."

Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,Very good tapas

Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"We went to eat on a Saturday and some of us wanted to order a sandwich and they told us that they didnt serve sandwiches because it was lunch time. I think that if someone wants to eat a sandwich, its also food. They force you to order a dish from the menu they have. I simply believe that a sandwich can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,October 23. Good service and good product at a reasonable price. Complete cheese board and aubergine chips. Well be coming back
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"We went to a friends birthday and the truth is that the treatment was great. Good waiters, an incredible flirt, delicious bravas, and all the tapas in general at a more than adequate price with very good quality. Charming cuco restaurant and waiters with constant smiles that make you feel at home. We will return for sure!!!"
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,We always celebrate birthdays and dinners there. It is homey as well as cozy and with a sophisticated touch. It is highly recommended and quality price with the landscape it offers is 10 Wheelchair accessibility: We were on the terrace and it was perfect
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"Very expensive and the coffee and the tortilla are very mediocre, the quality does not correspond at all to the price"
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,21:00 they dont make sandwiches... UNTIL LATER.
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,They speak badly in their language thinking that no one understands them

Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"I loved the place, good cuisine with very varied dishes and the attention of the waitress (the Spanish one with the ponytail) hahaha makes the stay very pleasant, a great city with quality people."
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,Good terrace to snack and have a drink. The waitress Raquel was very friendly and super efficient!!
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,The waiters are very friendly.
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"We had a snack dinner on the terrace and it was quite good. Friendly and attentive service. The pork snouts are very good. The chocos are a little salty for my taste but tender. The broken eggs and cheese board were very delicious. Good product, I guess taking advantage of the fact that they are right next to the Sant Antoni market. The barbecue looked very good but we didnt order it...for next time."
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"The best Rachel. The waitress that everyone expects to find in a bar: a very professional person, with excellent service and contagious friendliness."
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"The waiters are friendly and fast, as is the kitchen service. Excellent dice with green pepper, we ordered a double portion. We miss that the omelet was a little less cooked, but they make it on the spot and we didnt warn them, it was still good. For the main course we went for the fish (grilled salmon and goat-honey cod), they have a good product and a good hand at preparing it. The atmosphere is more than phenomenal. Very cozy place, especially for art lovers. We didnt know him and we loved the experience. We will return without a doubt."
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"I was there on Saturday with 2 friends who took me. And the waitress gave me a 10, she advised me on the delicious tapas, excellent service, professional, very affectionate and very attentive. It made us feel very good. I will recommend it. I will return with more people! Its worth having people like that working. Every day there are fewer."

Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"Good place to eat some tapas, but its expensive... The menu says there are sandwiches but on the weekend they told us there werent any. I recommend the calamari"
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,They lie when they say they have an ember. Dont even think about ordering the steak or chicken menu!
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,"First and last time! After they didnt ask me if I wanted to eat, I asked for a skewer of tortilla and 2 flags. I asked if the skewer came with bread and they told me yes, with coca. Then a tray arrived with a portion of coca bread and then the skewer with its corresponding bread with tomato. That is, leftover bread, when paying  18! Well, I didnt ask for that bread because I only asked if it came with bread and they charged me for it. Very bad service on the terrace, the waitress could warn us because these details make people angry and they lose a customer."
Restaurant Amigo Sant Antoni,I have to go see him
Veraz,"We went to do the Les Cols menu, the menu is very good and at an appropriate price. What we found exaggerated is the price for a glass of wine 9 and 10 euros (in a small glass and two fingers) and 5 euros for a coffee. Exaggerated But I repeat, the menu and its price are correct."
Veraz,
Veraz,
Veraz,"Was excited to eat the Barcelona Edition, as I LOVE the one in Tampa, but I was thoroughly disappointed. (My first hint should have been it was empty when we walked in) I headed over and got a drink on the rooftop bar. It was okay, the staff were not very attentive. They ignored us when we walked in and our 2 drinks took at least 25 minutes to be served. Other than that, the view was great and the drinks were pretty good. We then went downstairs to Veraz for dinner. The truffle butter and bread they serve is to die for but that is where anything pleasant about the experience ends. The staff were only slightly more attentive downstairs. I ordered the fish and my friend got the chicken and polenta. The waiter upsold us by suggesting some potato bravas, which were okay. My fish was inedible  I received a giant slab of dry, unseasoned fish with a tough blacked skin/coating (genuinely could not tell what it was) that I couldn t rip with my teeth. My friend s chicken was dry and bland, and the polenta also lacked flavor. We collectively choked down about 5 bites of our meals. I have never been served a worse meal at a restaurant and I am beyond disappointed after my fabulous experiences at the Tampa location."
Veraz,"We made a special menu from the restaurant les Cols with Chef Martina Puigvert, we thought it was very cheap."
Veraz,
Veraz,"Beautiful peaceful ambiance, gorgeous view, specially night and sunset. Food, cocktails and service were all great."
Veraz,"The service in the restaurant is very good, but the menu proposed by Martina Puigvert was not to my liking, the truth is, the first two dishes seemed like porridge and the cod was nothing out of this world, the carrot dessert is the only thing that is a little surprising , but it wasnt a big deal either."
Veraz,Very nice and exclusive cocktail bar! Connected to the Marriott Hotel
Veraz,
Veraz,"I had hoped to give this restaurant a higher rating, but, unfortunately, it was a true disappointment. While staying at the Edition hotel, we dined in for Christmas dinner with the set menu. Considering the price, the food was mediocre. The service was slow; were not sure if it was due to understaffing or if this is typical. After a 15-minute wait for coffee post-dinner, we decided to pass due to the lengthy delay. Most concerning, my partner experienced severe stomach issues the day following our meal. Since this dinner was our sole meal that night, it marred our last day in Barcelona. A regrettable end to our stay."
Veraz,"The food was fantastic, and the service even better. A calm and pleasant environment."
Veraz,
Veraz,
Veraz,Great place for tapas in El Born. Super good service and recommendations. Thank you Mariano for your attention. We loved the bravas and the cocktails. It will definitely come back.
Veraz,The experience was very well organized and I really enjoyed it. The place is cozy and the service was magnificent.
Veraz,"Fantastic event with David Seijas, in which I will undoubtedly repeat due to its excellent quality-price ratio, excellent wines, excellent music, excellent service."
Veraz,"The atmosphere is beautiful, the Hotels fragrance already has its peculiarity. The service is impeccable and the food is very local with a touch of personality. The patatas bravas are a specialty and the squid sandwich with black garlic aioli is incredible!"
Veraz,"Amazing night! The place is classy and first-level environment as well as the food, but the service and the drinks were something else. Mariano made sure our evening was espectacular as we felt special and taken care off while the bar tender totally understood what we wanted. Will come back shortly!"
Veraz,
Veraz,"What a great experience! All very good. Thanks to David Jr. who took great care of us, to Mariano and Andreas who were very attentive. We will be back!"
Veraz,A fantastic experience. We will repeat!!!
Veraz,"Honest market cuisine focused on the product. Fresh local and seasonal ingredients. They have an extensive wine list in collaboration with the award-winning Catalan sommelier David Seijas. The red vermouth tailor-made for The Barcelona EDITION Donzell Rojo Veraz by Padro i Familia, available at Veraz. Live acoustic performances by local artists every Friday and Saturday starting at 8:30 p.m., an event they call Local Sounds. You have the description of the dishes we tasted in the reel. Dont miss their award-winning patatas bravas!"
Veraz,"Magnificent bar located on the 10th floor of The Barcelona Edition hotel, next to the Mercat de Santa Caterina, where you can eat something tapas-based or have a drink while enjoying fantastic views of the old area of the city in a fairly quiet environment. Prices to match."
Veraz,
Veraz,
Veraz,
Veraz,Perfect for having a cocktail or a good glass of cava or wine and enjoying their tapas offering. Ideal afterwork
Veraz,Beautiful Rofftop
Veraz,Magnificent place to eat something at Veraz and then have a drink up on the terrace. The staff at both places are very friendly. Totally recommended
Veraz,"Excellent views from the rooftop, good service, reasonable prices and good atmosphere"
Veraz,We had lunch today and the service was underwhelming and honestly was so poor did not expect this kind of treatment in a five star hotel/restaurant. I would not recommend nor want to come back. And we asked for 3 things at the menu and did completely forgot about that order. Many thanks
Veraz,
Veraz,"Two couples went on a Saturday afternoon to have a few drinks, the atmosphere and decoration were super beautiful, plus a person singing live, livening up the moment. The truth is that it took them a long time to serve us, we were almost ready to leave, but we decided to stay and wait, they were served after about 20 minutes. Our surprise was when we went to pay and we were invited because of the wait we had. There were 3 beers and a wine. The truth is that I dont think they give this type of attention in many places. Thank you and of course we will repeat, for the kindness and atmosphere. Highly recommended restaurant."
Veraz,"We made a reservation for dinner and a drink on the rooftop, for a special occasion, Irene assisted us on the phone magnificently. When we arrived and wanted to go up to the rooftop, there was no availability and the person in charge of managing visits to the terrace could not have been more unfortunate or unpleasant. We decided to go to the restaurant to cancel our dinner reservation, luckily, David solved the problem for us and not only that, he made that night finally special. We need more people in the hospitality industry like David and Irene. Thank you! Thanks also to the rest of the team at Bar Veraz and the terrace. We will return since both the drinks and the dinner were very good, largely due to Davids professionalism."
Veraz,"Swanky high end feels, food wasnt anything special but great location and the upstairs bar had a real exclusive feel about it"
Veraz,Attention to details Top quality dishes and service Highly recommended
Veraz,Loved it! Quick stop off for tapas and drinks pre theatre.
Veraz,We ate very well in a very pleasant atmosphere. Recommended!!
Veraz,Lovely The best view for the  Gotic
Veraz,
Veraz,
Veraz,"I had the pleasure of going to Bar Veraz to eat last week. It was a pleasant surprise since we dont usually go to hotels, but since the Roof was full we decided to try the restaurant there. The food was very good, but more than anything it was the atmosphere and the warmth of those who worked. We were greeted by Andreas who was very friendly and recommended some of his drinks that were delicious. I would also like to highlight our waitress Milena who was very pleasant and her recommendations were very accurate. A place to recommend and repeat without hesitation!"
Veraz,
Veraz,"Incredible sirloin with cabbage!!! We have tried the tartare, sweet potato dessert and panettone, all super delicious and very friendly service! Thank you, we will be back soon :)"
Veraz,Vegetarian options: Tenen carta vegetariana Food
Veraz,"Sublime experience! The place is elegant and with an atmosphere that calls for tranquility. The dishes are extraordinary, especially those by chef Xavier Pellicer, and the attention of the staff is what I can highlight the most. After eating you can have a coffee or cocktail on the terrace and enjoy the spectacular view. I will definitely repeat!"
Veraz,"We went to brunch with the 35 euro menu. You can choose from a menu with quite a few 2-course options, coffees and mimosas are included. I liked the options, my order was great. The mimosas were somewhat  regulated , only during a certain period of time and it wasnt that they happened very often. But they have warned us that once you finish eating you could no longer order more, although that was not clear before the reservation, that is why I do not give a 5. The price is not bad but for me who has not drunk, for example, it is a bit More expensive than usual brunches."
Veraz,Nice place!
Veraz,

Veraz,
Veraz,"Relaxed atmosphere, luxurious but informal, fresh original dishes, superior service, better than the usual restaurants. Price quality top! For me a wonderful start when back in Barcelona"
Veraz,
Veraz,"We didnt have any food there because we saw the reviews and werent hungry. The pinxtos looked good though. They were prepared in advance, what might explain the bad reviews as they can sit there for a while before someone orders them. The decoration is very nice and the staff were very friendly. The drinks were nice. You do pay for the location indeed. All in all not a bad experience."
Veraz,To repeat whenever I can
Veraz,"The restaurant at the Barcelona Edition. We primarily had breakfast there and really appreciated that they opened early, were quick, and had tasty and healthy options. Prices were pretty reasonable."
Veraz,"Menu very pretentious, not very explanatory and excessively expensive. Of course, the unbeatable service although it obviously does not compensate for the quality or quantity of food for the price we paid. Egg whites for 6 euros, a hummus that is served as a sandwich with dry pita bread that is hard to swallow (it makes a ball, wow), exceptional croquettes of uncrushed octopus... And coffee with a small muffin that apparently looks delicious but in the mouth its a fraud: stale, thick, dry... how many days have you been making feta? Leaving hungry from a place where you paid 70 euros for two people should not be allowed... Never again."
Veraz,
Veraz,"We were there today to have a coffee, everything was perfect until they charged us  8.40 for two black coffees and  5 for a half-litre bottle of water. It seems a bit exaggerated to me honestly!"
Veraz,"I was passing through, but everything was very good."
Veraz,Good situation
Veraz,To be honest I dont even remember being here. LOL 5 stars by default.
Veraz,"One of the best cocktails Ive tried in Barcelona. In the heart of the Gothic Quarter and with a very extensive menu, it is the ideal place to have a drink on special occasions. The attention was more than up to the mark, Milena made our stay even more pleasant. Highly recommended! :)"
Veraz,Everything perfect and very kind.
Veraz,"Incredible bar with different cocktail options. The attention I received was top quality. Specially from Mariano who, from the beginning, was focused on us to have a great time. I highly recommend it for a special evening."
Veraz,
Veraz,"Plates, tapas and saucers. Outside they have a terrace of the historic Bar Alegria, but inside you can choose both the Veraz and Alegria menus. Excellent quality and presentation In the case of the service, although they are super friendly and attentive, they brought us the bread with tomato when we had finished eating (several tapas and a couple of main dishes) and the desserts when we had finished the coffee It would improve this coordination between dishes and service"
Veraz,Nerea has made the experience incredible! We will be back :)
Veraz,Nerea has been super nice!
Veraz,Magnificent location and site
Veraz,
Veraz,"Try to have an image, which does not correspond to the letter. Dishes, modern and a priori good, but the execution fails."
Veraz,
Veraz,
Veraz,Cannot say enough positive about this hotel! Highly recommend. The staff are so sweet and they provide the best customer service.
Veraz,"Its very good on the terrace, good service"
Veraz,"Excellent and attentive service at the restaurant/bar on the ground floor. Pulpo (octopus) cooked to perfection, probably the best I ve tasted. Custom-made cocktails too ;)"
Veraz,"Comments about Edition hotel. The location and facilities are good, but the operation is not so good. (There were several times when I felt a little suspicious, such as sharing information between the reservation staff and the front desk, and billing that differed from the accommodation plan.)"
Veraz,
Veraz,"In the old center of Barcelona, next to Santa Caterina. A place to enjoy good food in a quiet, cozy and pleasant space. Very friendly staff and good value for money. To recommend"
Veraz,"If you book the rooms with a terrace for $800 a night be prepared to listen to the music from the roof top bar until midnight each night. The music and bass vibrates through your room until you are sick. The rooms are located just under the roof top bar. Then in the middle of the night, a bunch of partying kids will wake you up at 2am as soon as you fall asleep. This is NOT a luxury hotel or 5 star experience. Truly awful"
Veraz,

Veraz,
Veraz,"This is our 2nd stay at The Barcelona EDITION, and we will continue to stay on future vacations. The hotel has sleek, modern beauty everywhere you look. The rooms are comfortable and will make you want to live here permanently. The property has 3 bar areas; we really enjoy their delicious cocktails at the rooftop, with a 360deg view of Barcelona in an elegant setting. The hotel is central to major attractions and walk-able to the best restaurants and bars. The most important reason to stay here is the welcoming staff and front of house manager Inigo, who made us feel right at home. All the employees here are friendly and always looking for a way to make your stay better. Until next time, Barcelona EDITION!"
Veraz,"The terrace and the bar were very beautiful and well maintained. It was difficult for them to start the service, especially with the food, but once the service started, it was excellent. There were simply some uncertainties about whether or not they had razor blades with lurdes water, but the rest was perfect. The food I tried was Tomas Abellan from Bar Alegria, excellent, creative, tasty and well presented. The potato in the tortilla lacked a little more poaching for my taste. I give it 4 stars for the CPR of the drinks, it shows that you are paying for a terrace at a hotel next to the market, nothing that is not surprising."
Veraz,"This hotel was absolutely incredible. My experience made me want to stay at an edition everywhere I go! The service was outstanding. Everyone who worked there was so kind and helpful. The room was beautiful and so was the lobby, and in the most perfect location. Definitely make sure to go to the rooftop while you re there!"
Veraz,
Veraz,"To be brief, simply not recommended. Very bad quality-price ratio. We will not return and of course we do not recommend it."
Veraz,"Last night we had a company event at the aforementioned hotel. The first problem was that we agreed on a time on the terrace and since we shared it with another group, at the last minute they changed our schedule, restricting it from what we had agreed upon. Although later, the other group canceled due to covid and they were super kind for us to stay and consume. Second, the menu that cost  50 per person was a pittance and Im not exaggerating, the quality was good but super scarce and the portions were ridiculous. I ate 4 minitapas and a dessert. We were quite hungry. The drinks theme was correct and the staff who served us on the terrace were super friendly. The third problem was that being on the terrace and with the heat of these heat wave days, we were in a room with glass partitions, open on one side, without air conditioning, and a terrible heat was generated like if we were in a greenhouse. We asked for fans and they told us they didnt have them, in a hotel!!! They didnt even have a single fan. Finally we managed to get the glass doors to open so that a little air could flow, so the air conditioning issue was null and void. This was our experience. In the end by treating customers like this, they lose because we certainly will not return and we will not recommend it to anyone either. Summary, some miserable peseteros!! The only wonderful thing was the views of the city."
Veraz,Luckily we only had a snack before eating at the Santa Caterina market.  6.00 for a beer and  3.9 for a still water.

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Mistreatment by the service. There are too many other places to eat to go to this particular place. Mistreatment by the service staff. Theres plenty of other places to go.
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"Fair prices and huge portions (we had dinner off the menu). The service is good; They are very very kind. The food itself is quite average, but as I say abundant. In other comments I have read something about poor cleaning, and I am afraid it is true (worms at least)"
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"My previous review included 5 starts with this review: Vegetarian menu del dia with great food selection. I found my new local Chinese restaurant. However, not anymore. I went there two weeks ago with my friend and we waited 30 minutes to order. I am not sure why they made us sit and wait for this long if they were not able to serve. The waitress with glasses was rude and angry when we asked to order, such a dissappointment. It is a shame because we used to be regulars."

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,I went late at night and ordered takeout food. Dont go to the point where youre like a Mon-Muggle because youre holding on to my arm. The owners response was friendly.
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Best quslity per price
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"It was very delicious. 9.8 euros for 4 menu items. I was surprised at how cheap it was. It wasnt enough for one person to eat, but... Unfortunately, the shiitake mushroom and beef plate was so salty that I couldnt eat much of it. The fried rice is excellent and recommended."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Very nice atmosphere and portios are big! Totally worth the money.
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"Very good food, definitely traditional Chinese food with flavors that are not pre-cooked. Ultra-fast service and even though the place is somewhat deteriorated, the quality of the food more than makes up for it, one of the best in Bcn."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"I love it, huge portions, incredible service. A traditional Chinese restaurant at an unbeatable price. I come whenever I can"
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"One of the best Chinese restaurants Ive ever been to. They are very friendly, the food is great and also a very good price."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"The people who work at the premises are very friendly. The quality of the food is very fresh and value for money is very good. If you are going to eat here, it is better to call to reserve because it is usually full."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,I was pleasantly surprised that for 9.90 a menu of 4 delicious dishes
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Fine
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Very good and cheap food.
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"This is a kind of excellent near home restaurant or a place to sit with a friend and have dinner.

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Delicious food in large quantities at an affordable price

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"It is the first time I have gone and tried the menu, I will return more times to eat dishes from the menu. I had been looking for a restaurant like the ones before for a long time and when I tried it, it seemed like it. Currently, in Chinese restaurants the marinade for the meat is dry and the meat is tough. But this one reminds me of the Chinese restaurants of the 80s-90s. Very good."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,Very nice people and the menu at a good price
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"Very good food and well priced. The noodles and tagliatelle are very good and the menus are affordable. They do takeaway Vegetarian options: They have vegetarian food like tofu soup, salad, noodles with vegetables, etc. Parking: You can park nearby on the street from Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for a fee and then it is free. There is a private parking lot where you can leave your car for a few hours but it is not very cheap. Kid-friendliness: It is a suitable place to go with children, but there is not much space to go with a stroller. Wheelchair accessibility: The main floor is wheelchair accessible, the upstairs is not."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"Very good Chinese food place. The menu is cheap and comes with a lot of food, with a drink and a dessert. I always return to that restaurant because, in addition to good food, the service is impeccable! Super friendly. I recommend."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"Without a doubt, the best Chinese food restaurant in the entire city of Barcelona!! The quality of the food is difficult to find in other places, and the quantity is so much that to leave they will have to open both doors. The attention to the public is impeccable, they will make you feel at home. There is a lady who naturally overflows with kindness and charisma, making the visit to the restaurant enjoyable. As for the quality-price ratio, you will not find the same in the Tetuan or Arco de Triunfo area (characteristic for Asian restaurants)"

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"This is real authentic Chinese street food. The cafe is staffed by members of the same family. I took the menu of the day, four courses (fried shrimp noodles, shark fin soup, dum sum and fried duck) with beer and ice cream. I barely got up from the table. For 10 euros!!))) I really liked it."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"The place shows its age...but the food Ive tried is quite good, hearty and plentiful. Its a good choice."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"Excellent service from the entrance, top ten attention and delicious food. We discovered it by chance, and we were delighted. We will return and recommend it without a doubt because it is one of the few places in Barcelona with a really good Chinese food and with such good treatment, everything clean, etc."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"My experience at this Japanese restaurant was average. Although the menu offered a wide selection of Japanese dishes, their execution varied in quality. Some dishes stood out for their freshness and authentic flavor, while others seemed to lack inspiration. The service was friendly, but the speed of service was spotty, with considerable wait times at times. The facilities were clean and tidy, but the atmosphere lacked an authentic Japanese atmosphere. In summary, while there were positive aspects to my visit, the areas for improvement are obvious, and I think with a few tweaks they could raise their rating."

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"I went to eat one day during the week and the menu cost  9.90, and you got 4 dishes to choose from, you had 3 starters to choose from, 3 seconds, 3 thirds and 3 fourths, and you got a drink, and coffee or dessert, The truth is that eating in Barcelona is super good, but in the end we chose dishes from the menu because we werent very hungry and we ordered some gyozas (very delicious by the way), some fried noodles with chicken and lemon chicken, the chicken The lemon is really wonderful, and as you can see in the images, the dishes are very abundant, the girls are lovely and very friendly."

Two types of 4 dishes menu - meet and vege, includes 4 dishes, desert and drink. For a very good price. If two people ask for a wine (as a drink included in 4 dishes menu) they get a whole bottle. For this price, no other place like this in BCN. Vegetarian options: Plenty to choose from. Not like in other places this type when even dish  tofu  contains meet. As a vegetarian I did not to feel awkward as happens a lot in other places."
Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"My best place to eat and share in Barcelona. Good food, good service, good everything. You have a good welcome as soon as you arrive, which makes you feel pleasant. Food is delicious. Seriously, I never tire of going nor do I stop recommending this place.

Cuina Xinesa Tradicional. Restaurant,"It really amazes me how this place gets almost 5 stars. Based on the dishes I received: Peking duck, wonton soup,  vegetable tempura, dim sum plate for 2, and the special fried rice - only 3 of the 5 seemed edible or with flavor. Not to mention, those dumplings seemed to come from a pre-made freezer packet from a generic Asian market. Wonton soup  had absolutely no filling with an oily and flavorless broth. The vegetable tempura has no love. It was like eating rough cut julienne veggies that were splashed into a deep fryer. It had No flavor and not even a typical sweet dip. The duck was decent. But its hard to mess up a fatty duck. Dont come here if you know what Asian food is, but unless you want cheap fried rice. Be warned!!!"

Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,. PROUD TO BE MALAYSIAN
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,This was my first experience with Malaysian food. Loved the roti canai with potato curry. And the service was very nice too.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Lady who served us was lovely and food was great and good price!
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Best food in Barcelona. Was excited to visit Barcelona for the first time having heard how great tapas could be but really Malaysian food is so much tastier! If you are looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable cost look to further. My kids begged to return after trying other restaurants. Kid-friendliness: Lots of flavourful options to choose from. Dont let the spice rating scare you, my children did not find any of the dishes we ordered too spicy, even the ones showing as the spiciest."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"100% Malaysian food, everything super delicious, very attentive and polite service, it was our first time eating here, everything was delicious and we will repeat without a doubt, I recommend to everyone!!!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Good restaurant, friendly service and excellent food. We have already gone three times."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"After having traveled all over Spain for the past two weeks and being ,quite frankly, tired of Spanish cuisine, this really hit the spot. As a Singaporean who now lives in the States, the food here was able to transport me back and fill me with a sense of nostalgia. My wife and I ate here for 3 days in a row due to how amazing the food was. Auntie Agnes and her staff were able to recommend and create a variety of mouth watering dishes. As you can see in the pictures, we ordered a plethora of dishes and covered a lot of the menu. The staff was world class and the service was impeccable. The dishes were authentic and the char kway teow and mee goreng even had  wok hei , something that s elusive in Asian restaurants in the western part of the world. The chilis- sambal, chili padi, and chicken rice chili were exceptional as well- every South East Asian knows that it s as important as the meal itself. The little details such as Achar(pickled vegetables) with the Nasi Lemak was an authentic touch I ve not seen outside of the  the motherland . While I may be biased, the labor intensive dishes such as nyonya kuehs-which are easy to overlook- are truly a work of culinary art. Overall gem of a restaurant. 20/10. One of the few reasons I would return to Barcelona. Thank you very much Auntie Agnes and the rest of the staff for the wonderful experience!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,The best Malaysia food ever. Agnis is the sweetest.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Amazing food and amazing service, definitely a must try if ever in Barcelona"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"It s really delicious!  Not surprisingly, they have the best nasi lemak in Barcelona, the barley water that goes with it is also very delicious, and the glutinous rice chicken is also very fragrant! I will come back next time!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Very good food, cool guys!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,So authentic
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Wonderful food. Even for vegans
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Amazing food, served by amazing people, nasi gore g and beef rendang are my personal favourites, very casual Restaraunt with affordable priced food a meal for 2 will cost around 40-60  but you will receive authentic food made fresh with love"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"The boss was very enthusiastic and recommended dishes. The nasi lemak and a coconut milk sago dessert are both delicious. The corn juice is very sweet and the taro cake is fresh but I don t like the sweet and sour taste. Overall very good, recommended!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Very tasty Malay cuisine. We ordered two dishes: butter chicken with roti and penang char kway teow with shrimps. The dishes were beautifully presented, juicy chicken, perfect sauce. The roti is delicious. The second course was equally tasty, great shrimps. Service also in English. We paid 31.50 euros for 2 dishes and 2 beers. A place worth recommending."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"9 days in Spain... I found this Asian restaurant because I wanted to stop eating bread and paella, and it was so delicious The seasoning wasnt too strong and all three dishes we ordered were delicious. Nasi goreng, noodle dishes, and even chicken skewers! This is my first Barcelona restaurant review."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Yummy Malaysia food style
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"We loved the place, but the service and food were still above. It was the first time, but we will surely return."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Very rich
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,I recommend
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Friendly service, butter chicken is very delicious"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"As a Malaysians, we can say that the food was really delicious and authentic  We enjoyed all of them and our little one enjoyed the mee goreng so much he gave a score of 20/10  The owner was so friendly and nice to us too. Definitely recommend this place! Dietary restrictions: Halal meat"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Authentic gastronomic experience, excellent service and delicious food, highly recommended"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,So delicious! I am not Malaysian but I spent a few months in Penang and to me the char keow teow and roti cannai were absolutely perfect. So yummy! Can t wait to come back and try laksa
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"The service attitude is super good, the fried rice is very fragrant, and the curry sauce is great. The boss said that he will be launching a new Hainanese chicken rice in the near future."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Crazy delicious. Amazing tastes, fragrance and textures."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Very authentic malaysian food. Super friendly aunty.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Food was very tasty, we had the mee goreng, sweet chilli tofu and chicken skewers. The sweet chilli tofu was different than what we have had previously but the flavours were still there. The Mee Goreng is highly recommended and was one of the best I ve had. The aunties running the restaurant were very friendly and we appreciated their passion for Malaysian food. Highly recommend and it s great to see authentic Malaysian cuisine in Barcelona."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Truly a fantastic experience at an authentic Malay restaurant. Every part of the visit was perfect. Good value, delicious food, outstanding service. We arrived just as they opened to make sure we got a table as we heard it can get very busy. We were greeted by such a glowing, happy woman who brought us to a table and went over the specials and gave us suggestions. She easily talked me into the barley juice they had that day. (It was delicious!) We ordered a lot of food, and every single dish was amazing and hit the spot. I did miss the tiny anchovies for the nasi lemak, but sometimes, other parts of the experience make up for a tiny lack of something I expected. In this case, the servers kindness made it exceptional. The satays were tasty and moist, although they were rather large chunks of meat. The Singapore noodles were exactly what I wanted and a good blend of savoury elements. Nothing was too oily, and they are not afraid of the spice here if you let them know. The char kway teow was exceptional. I dont even like prawns and the flavours were wonderful. The wok hei came through so well. I cannot express how much I loved the yam cake. I have been missing it so much and finally a place that does it expertly. It is quite a large restaurant with a big, colourful dining room, and a more intimate eating area in the front for people who just want to eat with a book, or similar, in a quieter section. As a little bonus, my partner is Cantonese, and the boss lady spoke Cantonese with her, which was such a delight as she rarely gets to so in Europe, and they have the same name! :) Malaysian food used to be one of my least favourite Asian cuisines, but because of restaurants like this is it up near the top now.  I cant wait to come back next time!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Very good food and good treatment from the waitresses
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"We came without much expectation and the truth is that we loved it. A while ago we traveled through Southeast Asia and the truth is that the food here is totally faithful to the dishes served in the area. They have been very friendly and my little children aged 2 and 5 have tried and enjoyed all the dishes, so I see it as a good place for families too. We have ordered the rice noodles, the butter chicken which was incredible, the shrimp wonton which we thought was delicious especially because of the frying (not at all oily), coconut rice and we have had a double portion of rotis. The only drawback, to say the least, is the price. Perhaps a while ago the prices would have been much more adjusted to the type of food, but today everything is the same, we paid  52 for the 4 of us. Without a doubt, we will continue trying different dishes again, because the menu is really extensive. Kid-friendliness: Of course they accept them and are nice to them. In addition, they have given us facilities when choosing the table for strollers and so on."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Amazing food and service. To come back
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Nice Malaysian food    Worth to eat.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"We had been staying close by and after seeing the great reviews were so curious to try it. We got their appetizer sampler and enjoyed it. The Laksa, which is their very popular dish, and for a good reason, was very flavorful! A bit spicy with a hit of sweetness."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,If you missed Malaysian food just go there.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"I m a Malaysian and the food here is authentic and really good. I tried the Nasi Lemak, Char Kwai Teow (in the photo). The Ayam Berempah fried chicken was really good."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Lunch with friends. The place is very well decorated, the service is very friendly and attentive. The food is very good. There are veggie options. Highly recommended."

Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Amazing food
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Super discovery! Everything is delicious, spectacular fusion of flavors!!!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Amazing place, must try the nasi lemak, penang char kway teow & laksa very good!!!!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Food is so good.  And the service is really nice. Felt the hospitality:)
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Delicious food and great service! Their bread is super tasty
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"I ordered a char kway teow and nasi lemak kampung The fried kway teow is full of flavor and the portion is generous. It s better than many fried kway teow I ve had in Malaysia! The rice at nasi lemak kampung is very fragrant and the fried chicken is also very crispy, very authentic. Both of these dishes are delicious. I recommend everyone to try them."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Pan& potato curry
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Very very good food! We will return 100%
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"It was my first time to try Malay food, and it was surprisingly delicious. The kway teow pot is full of flavor, the coconut milk rice is sweet, and the Malay special sauce is highly recommended."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,One of the best Asian restaurants in Barcelona
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,We had sambal fried rice. It comes with fried chicken and prawn. The fried chicken is super juicy and rich with flavours. The fried rice is definitely 10/10. Really love the spiciness

Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Surprising Malaysian food.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Foods are tasty and authentic, recommended! Services are very good too!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"It was my first time to try Malaysian food, and it was amazing! I ordered laksa noodles, fried rice noodles and fried rice, all very delicious. However, I saw that the laksa noodles are very spicy, but the price seems to have increased a lot Overall, the price/performance ratio is very high and I will come again~"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,The boss is very enthusiastic. Recommended!
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"I m Malaysian and took some work colleagues here. They absolutely loved it and I did too! The food was just like you would find in Malaysia (I especially recommend the char kway teow and the ayam goreng, the ayam goreng is just like you d find in the mamak) and was super tasty!! The staff were lovely as well and really enthusiastic. If you want good authentic Malaysian food in Barcelona with a great atmosphere this is honestly the place to go."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Delicious food - great service. Full range of Malay cuisine, which happens to be Halal friendly. Highly recommend potato curry roti to start. Wonderful service from Hannah throughout our meal, and very reasonably priced ( 23pp for 8 of us - no one left hungry.)"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Everything there was impeccable, from the service to the food! We received excellent recommendations from the staff and had an amazing diner. We went with a toddler and they were incredibly nice to her too. Excellent experience from start to finish with delicious dishes! Kid-friendliness: Great!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"The co-owner (aunt Agnes) is very sweet & friendly. I m Malaysian & this is by far the best Malaysian food I ve ever had in overseas (my own opinion). Not even close to some that I ve had in another EU/UK. We had penang curry laksa, char kuey teow, teh tarik etc. Definitely coming back here again if I visit BCN again."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"The lady boss was really enthusiastic about her food and explained the dishes in detail. I was missing Asian food on my European trip and decided to try this place. Overall I needed more punch, more kick to the flavours. But being 10,000km away from home, this is really a very decent experience."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"We loved everything we ordered, except the taro, which we ordered because the waitress recommended it to us, but we didnt really like it. The duck curry, very good!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"I dont know what is going on in that place lately. Weve been regular and satisfied customers (mostly via Glovo) but the last 2 times we ordered were totally the opposite of what we are used to. Yesterday we ordered Nasi goreng kampung and Kari laksa, which are 2 of our favourites. The last time the quality wasnt what it usually is, but it cant be 100% all the time 365 days per year, so we let it slide. But yesterday we were really disappointed. The portion of the Nasi goreng kampung has been sliced in two (as shown in the picture) with only 1 chicken wing, but still for the same price. And the Kari laksa....well sorry to say but it was awful. The soup had shifted, the noodles werent boiled enough, they were still hard and it all tasted like spicy water. The chicken tasted like a sponge, I dont know what part of the chicken that was, but it wasnt first quality, thats for sure. Not sure if we still going to order here....30 euros for 2 too small portions. Not cool."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Very good food and presentation of the dishes. The service is very pleasant and the place is clean and with a calm atmosphere.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"The food is exquisite, the staff incredibly friendly and the atmosphere simple and pleasant. I have eaten there several times and always try different dishes. Letting yourself be advised by the recommendations of experts is the best."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Went for the roti canai and was perfectly satisfied. The hokkien mee noodles were fine, a little overcooked. Service was adequate. Would return"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,One of the best Asian restaurants in BCN currently.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Amazing food and a warm and welcoming staff. Probably the best Malay food I ve had outside of Asia. Put this on your itinerary when you visit Barcelona
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Amazing laksa and nasi lemak. Could be a bit more spicy but the extra sambal sauce does the trick. The staff is really nice and helpful with the menu and Malaysian food.
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Second time we go, with friends. Good food. Very, very kind. In Asian restaurants I have to take care of myself due to a food allergy to a spice and they were very prudent and gave me options. Vegetarian options: There are many dishes with vegetables. Options for all tastes. Dietary restrictions: Very cautious with my allergies. I appreciate it. Wheelchair accessibility: At street level. Very clean adapted bathroom."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Super recommended! Careful attention, DELICIOUS food, large portions, we will definitely return! Too bad I only took photos of the dessert."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,Authentic Malaysian cuisine in Barcelona
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"The boss is from Malacca, and the food is very delicious and authentic! The food was served quickly and the service was very good. They recommended special dishes to us. The desserts were also delicious! If you come to eat in summer, you can try sago, which is cool and refreshing. The environment is also clean and quiet. I will come again!"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,I have never eaten Malaysian food before. The taste is very good and the price is not expensive. The staff in the store are very talkative and friendly. The overall experience is great!
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Restaurant vraiment tres propre. La cuisine est delicieuse, le service parfait. Nous avons ete accueillis avec le sourire, une attention particuliere pour les enfants alors que nous navions pas reserve. Nous etions 11. En plus dune cuisine fine et parfumee, la patronne nous a fait voyager en nous partageant de sa culture natale. Depaysement garanti. Je recommande."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Food wise, some hits & misses The laksa was very flavorful and large portion. No need to order anything else for 1 person. I asked for no meat and they happily removed it. The only thing Id change is the noodles. It was slightly overcooked and I was looking forward to the two different noodle types typical in laksa. Skip the roti canai. Its been over 10 years since I last had roti canai. I was looking forward to handmade, thin, crispy, flakey goodness. This was not it. Small, greasy, dense because its undercooked in the middle like a typical frozen roti. Ive made it at home. I recognize it. Expensive compared to other lunch options (16  laksa, 6  roti), but seems to be the norm in Spain for foreign food. Service was ok. Staff was friendly, food came fast. The roti took a bit longer. I was halfway done with my laksa when it came. Visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was ~30% full. Dietary restrictions: Pescetarian"
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"Sedap! It s the first time I got authentic mamak style food outside of Malaysia    if you expect the real deal, here you get it."
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,
Restaurant Malaysian Street Delights,"My family and I had been craving for Malaysian/Singaporean food after a week-long in Spain. It was great to have a taste of home in this restaurant! The nasi lemak was awesome, with thick curry and crispy fried chicken. The satay was juicy and tender, paired well with the dipping sauce. Fried rice and mee goreng portions were generous, good for sharing if you are a small-eater. And we finally found teh tarik in Barcelona! The 2 ladies who served us were friendly and attentive. Good service. Highly recommended for those whod like to try authentic Malaysian cuisines in Barcelona. Kid-friendliness: Many non-spicy options available for kids Wheelchair accessibility: Restaurant is spacious and located at ground floor"

Amades Restaurant,"Cozy place, good food and good music. We had a problem with the baked brie, it had walnuts and my daughter is allergic, they made the dish again without questions, a great detail. I recommend it 100%!"
Amades Restaurant,"Nous sommes venus a 6 gouter a cette cuisine locale de tapas pour feter les 25 ans de mon compagnon. Nous avons reserve via l application The Fork et nous avons ete bien recu. Placee a l etage, peu de monde, petite ambiance avec musique. Les tapas etaient succulentes. Prochaine fois a Barcelone, on y retourne sans hesiter."
Amades Restaurant,Un superbe restaurant dans le quartier gothique de Barcelone. Cuisine excellente et les serveurs sont d une gentillesse incroyable. Tapas excellentes. Croquetas au jambon ++ Paella super Et la sangria tres bonne Tres bon choix de dessert. Je recommande vivement. Muchas gracias a todos.
Amades Restaurant,"Very good place, super tentative owner; I personally love the cocktail! It s bitter it s sour and it s full of character! Also the paella was ace! It has a small Asian twist and adds the flavor! Def recommend it"

Amades Restaurant,"Best restaurant we visited in Barcelona. Cute service, best meal and atmosphere is magical   I liked it so much! We ll be back for sure"
Amades Restaurant,"Highly recommended if you pass through central Barcelona, very good atmosphere and attention, the guys are always attentive at all times, they make you feel at home. Delicious food and great variety. Without a doubt it is a mandatory visit whenever I pass through Barcelona. You are the best, thanks guys!"
Amades Restaurant,"Arrived in Barcelona and went here for a bite and a few drinks. The food was excellent and the bar staff were extremely good at his job. We returned another night just for drinks and gave him requests like a sweet gin cocktail, he presented drinks I ve never had before but they were amazing! Would definitely recommend !"
Amades Restaurant,"Great food and a lovely vibe, would recommend!"
Amades Restaurant,"We reserved a table for dinner. The restaurant is nice, well decorated although the place is not very big. You can see how they prepare the dishes, which gives confidence. They also have free wifi. We chose to share croquettes. They were two types of ham and boletus. I personally liked the boletus ones better, but both varieties were good. Then we ordered Grandmas cannelloni which was also very good. Then some meatballs, but we didnt like them very much, just like that. And finally the gratin cod, which was spectacular. For me the best of all was the cod, which is worth ordering. The attention of the waiters was very good, always attentive. And another plus point is that it is pet-friendly, they let dogs in without a problem. I would definitely return."
Amades Restaurant,"Bar man is literally magic. Great food too, just shut up and go here. You wont regret it."
Amades Restaurant,After walking the winding streets of Barcelona we found this old cozzy restaurant. They have great local wines and high quality tapas. All together a great experience.

Amades Restaurant,Love love love that this bar is open again. Such a lovely warm environment. Lots of locals and friendly bar staff. Yummy food and a range of drinks. What more could you want??
Amades Restaurant,"Came here a few nights ago and was instantly seated even without a reservation. Food was amazing, their take on patatas bravas is my favorite. I also had the steak and croquettes. Didn t manage to get a picture of the steak but it was delicious! The service was also great; everyone was very friendly and quick to get you whatever you requested. The wait for our food was also not super long. All in all it was a 10/10 for me"

Pata pollo restaurantes,"The classic burger was delicious, and the potatoes were amazing!"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"100% recommendable!! Abundant and delicious food. We ordered the menu of the day which was - 1/2 spicy chicken (medium size), house fries, aioli sauce, cane and ice cream x  12.50 - 1/2 spicy chicken (medium size), thin potatoes, spicy sauce, a glass of white wine and ice cream x  12.50 Very cordial attention, spacious, clean and pleasant place."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Very delicious, I recommend the roast chicken with potatoes"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Apart from the lack of food and how unfriendly the waiters are, they charged me 18 euros for a chicken thigh with 4 potatoes, and two slices of bread FOR 4 EURIS DONT EVER COME ASUI, THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHICKEN IN THE WORLD"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"At Pata pollo Restaurant there are many chicken dishes, as the name suggests. The Spanish menu is presented in paper form, the English menu with a QR code. However, the English menu is not actually English; Here too we needed a translator as much of the work was in Spanish. We had cheeseburgers with fries. The fries were different... very thin and seasoned with rosemary; YUMMY! The burgers were tasty and juicy. The ambience wasnt that nice. Chairs uncomfortable and quite fresh in the restaurant. It had a bit of a  garage atmosphere ."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"I went to try the nuggets buffet when they went viral and both my partner and I loved it, a group of friends and I went back to repeat it and we were satisfied again, today they NO longer offer the nuggets buffet and I dont believe I would eat here again since the menu of the day was very small portions for the extra price of  14 with a supplement for soda that should be on the menu, very nice place, good service, good but scarce food. I hope the buffet returns as that is why I held the restaurant in such high regard."
Pata pollo restaurantes,Excellent everything

Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"The protein strips are great! In addition, they have natural wines from the area and everything is very well priced"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"A very quiet place. We had tapas and everything was delicious, they also had a romcom playlist which is everything a girl could ask for on a Friday night."
Pata pollo restaurantes,Fantastic!!!
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Bad experience: the waiter who served us despised us for speaking Catalan, he did everything possible to get us to switch to Spanish. You could tell that it wasnt because he didnt understand her, but because he couldnt understand us."
Pata pollo restaurantes,Many thanks
Pata pollo restaurantes,"My first visit to the city of Barcelona, a friend brought me and I fell in love with the cold beer and some portions of potatoes with Ali Olia and roast chicken sauce that wow, how are the potatoes! 10 out of 10 I will return without hesitation!!!"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"The food is just amazing! Tasty, fresh and not oily. Service is kind and helpful. I could get along with them very easily, and without any problems. Prices are in the mid range, but I can recommend food for the price!"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Tres bon et personnel sympa,mais il fait froid dans le resto"

Pata pollo restaurantes,Good pretty and cheap Recommended 100
Pata pollo restaurantes,"The waiter was very nice after the shift change, the shop is unfortunately very cold (January) there are patio heaters outside, its really cold inside. The toilet area is underground. Cleaning it every now and then could really help. The  fries  are extremely thin and very oily. Unfortunately, we realized too late that half the chicken was billed as a whole."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Very good place and very delicious food, greetings."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"All very good but the menu is a bit simple, missing sauce, bread and some more elaborate dessert."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"The food was very delicious, the accompanying potatoes were delicious, and the bravas were also very good and with abundant sauce. Maybe a little expensive, but not bad."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Restaurant specializing in fried chicken, many varieties on the menu"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Two vegetarian options looked interesting and ordered one.  Almost 15mins. after ordering one, the waiter came to inform that they dont have.  Asking for the other v option, sure enough they also dont have!"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"We paid 33 euros for two very small quarters of roast chicken, really small, accompanied by white rice, about 50g per person, a correct hummus, a coffee and two waters. It seemed like an armed robbery to me if I value the price/quantity ratio. Its a shame because the service is attentive, but we left hungry paying almost 17 euros per head. The quarter chicken portion is ridiculous."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Occasionally we come to try the menu of the day and we have returned more than 10 times, because we love the quality of the food, the attention and the flavors! There is variety on the menu, dishes with vegetables (escalivada) or chicken breast cooked at a low temperature, different types of potatoes and for me, they are some of the best, and homemade sauces. Off the menu, there is a dessert that I love - a salted chocolate mouse. The interior may look simple, but it is clean and pleasant. Vegetarian options: escalivada"
Pata pollo restaurantes,Excellent service. Good food We were very surprised. The place a little cold. But I really enjoyed it.
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,Food and attention from 10. Highly recommended.

Pata pollo restaurantes,We come here at least once a week for lunch and love it! One of the best  menus  in Barcelona. The service and food is spectacular. Edu and Anto are the best. Super friendly and great service. I highly recommend this place for anytime.
Pata pollo restaurantes,Best
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,good chicken
Pata pollo restaurantes,Lunch menu very correct! We really liked the chicken and the thin potatoes (they serve them with the sauce separately and are well seasoned!). Desserts little variety (different types but only ice cream or 1 apple). good deal To repeat!
Pata pollo restaurantes,"The food was very delicious, and it didnt take long at all. Very friendly staff. I do not have much more to say; I felt sorry because the place is big and it was just us and another family having dinner. Lets see if these reviews can fill more."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Very good treatment and the croquettes look very natural. Very good place, I will come back for sure and the atmosphere is very cool."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Nice, central place, with seemingly good food and relatively high prices. The service could be better and the space too cold."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Personally I had higher expectations with the chicken... but for my taste it was very oily and I expected it to be crunchy, but a carrasco disappointment... The chicken a last was too small... and the fries were soft... The sauces dont kill you either. The bathrooms are very dirty The place is good and the service is good too"
Pata pollo restaurantes,Very friendly and polite waiter and good teak

Pata pollo restaurantes,"We made the tapantoni and the croquettes were very delicious, the place is also very cool."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Very good food with a chicken base, but the salads are also very good. Well be coming back!!! Kid-friendliness: Children of any age can go. Wheelchair accessibility: Yes... the whole restaurant is at the entrance and although the toilets are downstairs there is a toilet upstairs for wheelchairs."
Pata pollo restaurantes,We had a very pleasant time trying the Tapantoni croquettes on the terrace. Very rich! The waitress Noora is super nice and attentive to our dogs.. thank you!!
Pata pollo restaurantes,I have never experienced better service. Noora not only gives great advice but also has a great positive energy.
Pata pollo restaurantes,"A good everyday place for good quality burgers, chicken and more.  Friendly wait staff."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Some delicious croquettes as well as the fingers and fine potatoes, we will surely repeat"

Pata pollo restaurantes,"Best chicken sandwich in the world. Cant wait to try them all. I mean it, the world. Ive tried chicken sandwiches, everywhere from California, Texas, France, and to Korea. Hands down the best chicken sandwich"
Pata pollo restaurantes,It doesnt have a plate   the usual combo   to go for a snack is fine but go hungry you better go to Burger King
Pata pollo restaurantes,The best chicken alast by far
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Good food. Very good attention. Desserts, although delicious, seemed expensive for the size. Kid-friendliness: They have high chairs"
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Beaut! 1/4 chicken and partner had club sandwich. Should have gone 1/2 chicken.....Moist, tasty, fresh."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Very good, the bad thing is that there is no coke."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Delicious food, we were a group of 6 people and we all ate very well. Totally recommended for both chicken lovers and those who dont love it so much. We will go again 100%. A shame its not better known."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"After experiencing its beginnings and seeing how it is now.... The truth, I wont go back. Its my personal opinion, Im sorry..."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Wow, just visited for a lunch, as a local friend told me this was the best chicken in bcn, he was definitely right.. 23  drinks and few plates to share and a main dish each. Servers were prepared and welcoming.i appreciated the design of the venue aswell"
Pata pollo restaurantes,Everything terrible
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"The smell of their roasted chicken grabbed me, and I am grateful for that."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,Great food - I had healthy chicken and rice when I was unwell due to a stomach bug and my friends had burgers. Chicken is very tasty and burgers and fries were delicious. 3 people paid 60 euro and we ate and drunk more than enough! It is a great spot!
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Ive never had chicken burgers like this before!!! The quedo was brutal and the thinly cut potatoes with chicken a last flavor were incredible, I was very surprised!!"
Pata pollo restaurantes,

Pata pollo restaurantes,"The place was very good and comfortable, the service was very good the potatoes were excessively greasy, the bread was hard in the Club sandwich which had very little chicken I recommend it to anyone, and both me and the person I went with felt bad about the food."
Pata pollo restaurantes,
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Chicken and bravas. Well, honestly, I think chicken is a bit expensive. Bravas was okay, cheap and And VAT was excluded... A little disappointed as the price was higher than expected"
Pata pollo restaurantes,Well as expected from the reviews I was not disappointed at all! Food was GREAT! Service was GREAT! Will be back definitely
Pata pollo restaurantes,"Imagine needing to change the tampon and they deny access to toilets because it s  only for guests . While two guests are there  the rest is empty. I didn t want to buy food, I just needed to change a tampon. I would have paid 50 cent but because of that  friendliness  I didn t bother anymore. Restaurant next door: full of guests, using the toilet for free was not a problem at all."
Pata pollo restaurantes,"As for the site, the atmosphere and the staff, without a doubt very good service. My disappointment and disappointment was when I tried the Nuggets, it is a seasoned dough that didnt really taste like chicken, it only tasted like seasoning and apart from those that werent burnt, they were raw.."
Pata pollo restaurantes,Quelle belle surprise que ce restaurant specialise dans le poulet. Il y a assez de variete pour tous les gouts et la cuisson de la viande y est parfaite. Les serveurs sont tres sympathiques et lendroit est tres propre. Une bonne pioche a Barcelone!

SLOW&LOW,"Tasting menu with pairing, innovative. Excellent service, friendly and close. If you go with a partner, I recommend la barra, its very interesting."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"If youre not a fan of fish served in a 17-course meal, all drenched in the same monotonous sauce, then its best to steer clear of this establishment. For those seeking attentive service and an English explanation of each dish, this place might not live up to your expectations. Moreover, if youre in pursuit of a delightful experience in a charming atmosphere, you might want to look elsewhere."
SLOW&LOW,"Slow&Low is signature cuisine, it is 5-star food and treatment. However, it is not an experience for all budgets! It is a restaurant where food translates into art!"
SLOW&LOW,I liked a lot. Everything excellent

SLOW&LOW,"During my stay in Barcelona, I had this experience that will not leave me with an imperishable memory. I was really disappointed with this restaurant that looked excellent with a culinary experience on the other hand, He doesnt deserve his star at all. When I got there I already noticed the atmosphere that was catastrophic, too loud music and a playlist worthy of a highway restaurant. A room with a decoration and comfort that leaves something to be desired. The waiting time between some dishes is far too long about 20 minutes for some dishes. My meal took me 3 and a half hours of my time with the smallest menu. The dishes were beautiful but with a really special taste, pumpkin ice cream and mediocre desserts. Some dishes were laid naked on petals that seem to be reused for each customer. The dishes are very salty and very spicy. The spicing of the dishes by the way that seems to be a hide of misery. In short, errors can happen in the distribution of Michelin stars."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"Truly one of the best experiences my boyfriend and I have ever had. The food, the service, the professionalism and unique flavors/dishes were so amazing and we can t recommend this restaurant enough!!!! It deserves 5+ stars no questions about it! If you are non picky and a foodie wanting to appreciate a Michelin starred restaurant this is one to 1000000% add to your list, you won t regret it! Thankful for the amazing service provided to us, each waiter was so kind and carefully trained we appreciated every detail. <3"
SLOW&LOW,Its quite an experience. Highly recommended! We chose the bar option in front of the kitchen and the truth is that it was a success in every way.
SLOW&LOW,"The customer service is exquisite, without forgetting the wonder of flavors you taste. Without hesitation, I would repeat"
SLOW&LOW,Frankly friendly! Dietary restrictions: Pay attention to celiac disease.
SLOW&LOW,Explosion of flavors
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"A very attentive restaurant, it would be better for Asians if the pace could be faster! There is room to improve the wine pairing"
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,A great discovery. Very good food and a fantastic team that makes it a great experience.
SLOW&LOW,"Absolutely tremendous!! Friendly staff, great dishes,  excellent chefs,  just a perfect evening!!"
SLOW&LOW,"Definitely yes! There is so much flavor in all of those dishes that your tongue receptors are in shock. We choose 15 dishes for 115  each, they were served to us during nearly 2 hours. Timing was amazing because we were served all of those dishes with a good interval and never got bored. We had a choice of 17 dishes for 140  and 21 for 180 . Personally for me 15 dishes were more than enough, at the end I was completely full. One thing to point out, is that the waiter took away the cocktail and I haven t finished it yet."
SLOW&LOW,"It s alright for a one-star Michelin restaurant. Staff was really trying to be friendly and all, but a few were a bit snobbish. Was sitting at the bar which was the best place, also to observe the staff cook. Back side was a bit awkward. Food tasted pretty good. Pace was good too. Nice location."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"We ate very well. To go to this restaurant you have to have time and not be in a hurry. The parade of dishes is wonderful and delight is guaranteed. They paid attention to the ingredients that I couldnt eat, and they modified my dessert. The quality-price ratio is worth it."
SLOW&LOW,"Il est toujours delicat devaluer si les restaurants de ce calibre justifient les depenses importantes. Bien que je ne sois pas un habitue de ce type detablissements, je dois reconnaitre que lexperience offerte etait remarquable, et la satisfaction etait au rendez-vous. Nous avons particulierement apprecie lopportunite dobserver les chefs a l uvre pendant la preparation des plats. Le service etait a la hauteur des attentes associees a un restaurant de ce niveau. Si je devais formuler une suggestion damelioration, ce serait au niveau de laccord mets-vins, qui netait pas toujours optimal. De plus, les desserts semblaient quelque peu ordinaires en comparaison avec le niveau delaboration des plats precedents. En depit de ces points, lensemble de lexperience etait tres positive, et cela reste une adresse que je recommanderais."
SLOW&LOW,"From the moment you walk in the door, with those incredible smells to the end of the menu, the experience has been incredible. Without a doubt, a highly recommended place, for the gastronomic experience and the great treatment they offer you. We will repeat and try their more extensive menus. Thanks for the experience"
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"Ideal place if you want to taste innovative and delicious dishes. There are two atmospheres inside the restaurant, one next to the kitchen, the other more private. I failed about the wines, they were not to my taste even though the price was quite high. We also didnt like too much that we were charged  4 per person for a bottle of water that they hardly refilled our glass."
SLOW&LOW,Worth a visit :)
SLOW&LOW,"They charged us full price when we could not attend because we got sick. We had lunch and dinner several times there and the restaurant has not considered this at all, to potentially not charging us the full menu. Not coming back, after the treatment received. Is a pity to see what is your consideration towards your loyal clients, which were there before you became relatively famous."
SLOW&LOW,"Very impressive and delicious meal. Some of the dishes tested our palette (quite fishy!) but it was a great experience overall. The environment, staff and ambience really made the meal even more magical. Thank you Marco for looking after us. Kitchen staff very friendly. We had the option to sit at the bar to see the kitchen but decided against this so that the food was more of a surprise! Pictured is the first dessert course."
SLOW&LOW,"Wonderful experience and such thoughtful food pairings and flavor profiles. Very rich experience with a focus on seafood and semi asian inspired flavors. The 11 courses was perfect for me and my mother and the wine pairings very nicely complimented each dish. All delicious but a few standout favorites : cucumber three ways and fried chicken,  Bloody Mary  shrimp, mushroom pasta, oyster and horchata, fish lettuce tacos, and the tangerine sorbet and mousse"
SLOW&LOW,"They gave us a tasting menu. We enjoyed each of the different dishes and the wines that accompanied them, a true festival of the senses. They truly do more than honor the star they shine, highly recommended. We are already thinking about when we can return."
SLOW&LOW,The tasting menu is not up to par. Disappointed me
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,Great technique for all dishes but a bit too salty
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,Trop trop long 3h15 pour un diner dommage car cuisine excellente
SLOW&LOW,". -Dinner is Slow&Low, one shrimp can be eaten in two ways, pasta, lobster and cup lobster Cappuccino are very delicious. But the meat at the end was not good. The juice didnt add to the dish at all, but the meat taste was not outstanding at all. The process was like going up to the top and falling down on a roller coaster. But overall, I am very satisfied with it. The waiters are very friendly, humorous and first-rate."
SLOW&LOW,Great culinary experience with a tasting menu that they dont tell you about until it is in front of you with a mix of Asian and Mexican flavors (and Mediterranean of course)
SLOW&LOW,"Quality and cooking technique very good. They treated us great. We only had one bad memory because the bottle of wine they recommended to us did not fully meet what we had requested and, in the end, they overcharged us for a simple infusion and a coffee after having chosen two tasting menus of  140/ person."
SLOW&LOW,"One of the best meals I ve ever had in my whole life. Absolutely incredible. Hard to believe they have only 1 Michelin star!! I hope more recognition is in their future!! The staff goes above and beyond and all the chefs are so passionate about what they do. 10000% recommend. Attention to detail like no other. If you enjoy seafood, this is an experience you don t want to miss."
SLOW&LOW,"A unique location with a great menu. Quite expensive, but worth every euro. We have rarely eaten something so innovative. We sat right in front of the kitchen and could watch the chefs. Just great. Clear recommendation."
SLOW&LOW,Without . Words
SLOW&LOW,"Una experiencia 100% recomendada! Los platos mezclan sabores mexicanos y asiaticos, con productos locales y con un toque que los hace unicos. El servicio es impecable, cada miembro del staff se asegura de que no se escape ningun detalle. Me he sentado en la barra, lo cual me ha permitido ver de cerca como preparaban los platos y ha sido espectacular."
SLOW&LOW,That was probably one of the best restaurants I have been in my life. Chef Nico is an amazing person and has created tastes for the right reasons. I would eat again 100% - chefs table is a treat. Many thanks for a great night
SLOW&LOW,"Very very good dinner, with a perfect atmosphere to celebrate an event as a couple or with friends. Very fine, precise and varied cuisine, with an unexpected Mexican touch! Bravo and thank you."
SLOW&LOW,"Wonderful experience. Food was delicious (tried other 1 star restaurants during my stay and this one was the best), attentive staff. Great experience that I would recommend!"
SLOW&LOW,Great quality and atmosphere. Magnificent wines
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"The best dinner of my life! Delicious menu with pairing. Very attentive staff, chef included. Everything fantastic!"
SLOW&LOW,"Unique and unbeatable experience...tasting menu without rivals, important wine list!"
SLOW&LOW,Its an experience. We have been going to the restaurant since 2021 and it is always evolving and changing. Very good dishes.
SLOW&LOW,"Experience mitigee pour notre part. On nous annonce un menu 17 plats, ou finalement 2 mignardises d entree et 3 de dessert compte comme 5 plats. Pas vraiment correct autant dire 12 plats + mignardises. La cuisine etait pour certains plats (2-3) tres bonne mais pas exceptionnel pour les autres. C est dommage. Adeptes des restaurants de ce genre, j avoue que nous sommes un peu decu. Seul le service est a la hauteur avec des serveurs sympathiques. Sinon on se sent un peu arnaque par la promesse"
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"I dont give it more stars for details that are important in restaurants where you pay  140 for the menu, and  115 for the pairing. - that they charge you more than  4 a bottle for water, that they charge you  17 for a glass of red wine or  9 for a shot of mezcal... - very uncoordinated and chaotic service. Each dish is brought to you by a different person, including also different people to serve the pairing that often came out of time with the dishes, many times between dishes it was very slow. - the chairs at the bar end up being very uncomfortable, your legs even fall asleep... There are other restaurants with a Michelin star that are much more recommended."
SLOW&LOW,"Perfect experience, food and treatment."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"The tasting menu as well as the wine list have a price, I never thought that they would charge me for the water or the shots they offered us (this is probably my fault and for other people it is more than obvious). From the tasting menu, three preparations seemed really spectacular to me, the rest were good but not remarkable. Good atmosphere and good treatment. Personally I will not repeat because for me the experience versus the price ( 350 dinner for two) is not worth it."
SLOW&LOW,"Great experience, excellent work on flavors and textures. A complete tasting menu. The kitchen is visible and you can see the preparation. Even if you eat at the bar, the space and privacy is enough."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"Long story short: a must visit. My husband and I went tonight for our honeymoon and we had the best time. The food is amazing and bursting with flavor. We loved each dish. We did the pairing menu and really enjoyed the selection. The ambiance and the staff are truly the icing on the cake. Everyone was so warm, educational, and talented. A wonderful experience. A true 5 stars."
SLOW&LOW,"I have gone to many high-class places to eat, but this place has undoubtedly been my favorite, I have really liked others but this is the only one that has managed to excite me. Regarding the attention, it is the best I could find. I made a mistake with the day of the reservation and they were kind enough to make room for us and assist us. A resounding 10"
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"One of the most special meals I ve had anywhere! Beautiful, tasty, thoughtful plates; gorgeous decor and talented, thoughtful kitchen and floor staff. Highly recommend sitting at the front bar seating to really feel part of the whole preparation and serving experience. Dietary restrictions: Kitchen is very accommodating of intolerances and allergies"
SLOW&LOW,"Wonderful experience. Service of 10, food that cannot be described, you have to experience it. Quite a trip! Wonderful atmosphere. Thank you for this experience. Quite a gift."
SLOW&LOW,Spectacular!!
SLOW&LOW,Fantastic team! Just have no words...Best experience in Barcelona!
SLOW&LOW,"Really fun tasting menu experience, staff were nice and accommodating to our allergies. Beautiful presentation as well. You can pick between 13 courses or 15 with wine pairing."
SLOW&LOW,"Chef Nicholas and his team have created a culinary masterpiece with Slow&Low! Every single dish of the 17 course menu was mouthwateringly delicious. The dishes are influenced by Mexican, Asian and Catalan cuisines and are perfectly balanced. We loved the smell, textures and taste of these creative dishes and will def come back soon. Our bill was a bit short of 400  but it was absolutely worth it."
SLOW&LOW,"A simply excellent place. Very cozy, with very friendly service and spectacular cuisine. Above all, if you want to repeat a glass of wine, keep in mind that each glass costs  100. Still, it was worth it."
SLOW&LOW,"A friend gave us a tasting menu and the experience has been fantastic. Very good product and very well presented. Very attentive and pleasant staff. We liked the atmosphere very much, very relaxed. Experience to repeat."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"Nos attentes etaient elevees et au final notre experience ne fut pas totale selon nos criteres mais nous ne regrettons pas notre visite. Les oursins c est bien essayes mais ca ne marche pas selon nous. De meme que nous n avons pas apprecie le canard. Pour le reste rien a redire. Certains des plats etaient divins et valent certainement le detour. Sur les 17 plats plus des 3/4 nous ont plus. Les presentations sont impeccables mais pas toujours presentees de maniere uniforme (nous etions quatre). Le chef, de meme que le personnel, sont sympathiques avec un grand plus pour les deux membres de la brigade parlant francais). Le decor est contemporain et agreable. Manger face a la brigade est egalement une question d appreciation mais qui selon nous a le merite d etre transparent et convivial."
SLOW&LOW,Modern cuisine with Mexican influences. Good time
SLOW&LOW,"In establishments with a Michelin star or stars, it is usually common to enjoy their creations on a tasting menu. At Slow&Low they have two. The only difference between them is that one has two more preparations than the other. We decided on the longest one. A day is a day!! Its not easy to value stars!! When we go, we opt for a general assessment that includes the preparations (starters, cold, hot, desserts, etc.), the appearance and quality of the product presented, the explanations, the service, the wine list, the premises and some other information. that we consider important. On this occasion, it seemed to us that something hotter was missing. As for the rest of the parameters, we cannot ask for more. There is even the possibility of being at the bar, with the added bonus of seeing how the preparations are made. Next time, well sign up."
SLOW&LOW,Very good food and very little... not even with 17 dishes and no bread
SLOW&LOW,"They definitely deserve the michelin star. Great service, atmosphere, and food."
SLOW&LOW,"TL;DR: Slow & Low is a culinary gem in Barcelona that offers an exceptional dining experience. Chef Nicolas passion for food, the warm hospitality, and the culinary masterpieces make this restaurant a must-visit. With a well-deserved Michelin star, Slow & Low is a place where you can enjoy exquisite food in a welcoming environment. The ambiance is a harmonious blend of rustic charm and contemporary elegance. The soft, warm lighting and the tasteful decor create an inviting atmosphere that immediately makes you feel at home. The open kitchen design allows you to witness the magic as it happens, adding an element of theatre to the dining experience. Chef Nicolas is not just a master of his craft, but also a charismatic host with a contagious passion for food. He happily took the time to discuss with us, sharing stories about his dishes, their ingredients, and his culinary journey. This personal touch adds a unique dimension to the dining experience, making it feel like an extraordinary meal at a friends home. Each dish is a culinary masterpiece, crafted with carefully sourced ingredients and presented with impeccable attention to detail. The flavors are deep, complex, and truly harmonious. The Long tasting menu (along with the wine pairing option, which I highly recommend) is definitely the way to go. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Slow & Low and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special dining experience in Barcelona."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"Upscale cuisine with an extremely good price-performance ratio for this price segment. The Slow & Low definitely deserves the Michelin star. Super tasty, great service and an owner with passion. He has a very special sense of taste. Gladly again"
SLOW&LOW,Atmosphere was amazingly warm. The staff was more than willing to make our night remarkably pleasant and delicious. Wine pairing is a must! Food
SLOW&LOW,"5-star experience all around. Had an outstanding meal here, unique dishes, great flavors, and service was impeccable. They time the courses out so thoughtfully along with the timing of how they served each dish to me and my boyfriend, perfectly in sync. Worth every penny."
SLOW&LOW,"Service was amazing, food was amazing"
SLOW&LOW,"They should be more responsible in the after-sales service, since they are not responsible for foods with side effects."
SLOW&LOW,"Super atmosphere, incredible staff... not to be missed"
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"One of the Best ! As I travel I look to find new gastronomic experiences. Some times food stalls, some times Michelin star. Slow&Low is the latter, and completely deserving of the star. I found the whole performance perfect. Food, Service, Ambience, was excellent. I think the price is also exactly correct for the quality of food & service provided. If youre looking for a Michelin Star experience in Barcelona, I doubt you will be disappointed here. I could not fault one course."
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,"Excellent tasting menu, varied and creative. The service is also excellent. A highly recommended experience."
SLOW&LOW,"With all the rich fine - dining pickings available in Barcelona, choosing one when I only have one night was tricky. Slow and Low came recommended and I am glad I listened.  Great first impressions, very welcoming crew. I requested a counter seat so I could be where the action is. I did a wine pairing degustation and thoroughly enjoyed it. Meticulously prepared food, not over done, interesting menu. Great camaraderie amongst the crew.. All From different parts of EU and everyone spoke English. Great un intrusive but highly personal service. I highly reccommend this establishment!! Let the pictures speak for the creativity and finesse. Thank you for a memorable meal. Well deserved Michelin award.!"
SLOW&LOW,
SLOW&LOW,Perfect as always!
SLOW&LOW,Everything was perfect in this  17 courses tasting menu and the wine pairing is the cherry on the cake ! Thanks for everyting !
SLOW&LOW,Very good food and exquisite presentation.
SLOW&LOW,"It is not the first time that I have eaten in a starred restaurant, I have repeated in several, and the truth is that I would not recommend this one even to try it. Great claims but fails in important aspects: very poor service (I called to resolve some questions and after 6 attempts without luck and writing emails with no response, they finally answered the phone being rude and unpleasant). The food is not bad, they fuse oriental, Mexican and Mediterranean food (those types of innovations that everyone does) but after a few hours I did not remember any dish (out of a total of 17!), when I am able to remember a few of restaurants I went to years ago. It is in places like this that there are people who criticize haute cuisine... They commit all the sins. If you havent been, better look for other places... All that glitters is not gold."
SLOW&LOW,"The tasting menu is a delight for the senses. Quite a gastronomic experience. The treatment by all the staff and the partners, responsible for the menu, is very professional and close. It is a pleasure to hear how they conceive the dishes, you can see the love they put into each one of them. A highly recommended experience."
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,"Very good service, good recommendations if you ask the waiters. Very attentive. They change the menu according to the season of the year."
Restaurante Tortuga,Cozy place and very friendly waiters. Very good food and very good service.
Restaurante Tortuga,"Lots of quality, but little quantity. A bit like Joao Felix at Barca"

Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,Cuisine Incroyable!
Restaurante Tortuga,I had dinner there yesterday with my partner and everything was great. Very pleasant restaurant and service and very delicious dishes.
Restaurante Tortuga,I especially recommend the Turtle Egg and the Sweet Dreams dessert.
Restaurante Tortuga,The food and service was really good
Restaurante Tortuga,Excellent gastronomic experience. Very friendly and helpful staff. The dishes are very good and elaborate. We will be back
Restaurante Tortuga,"Tortuga is a small restaurant with an open kitchen, which allows you to see the preparation of the dishes but this does not save guests from leaving the restaurant with a smell of food which may not always be pleasant. Overall very nice and very friendly staff The food is good as is the quality-price ratio"
Restaurante Tortuga,"I will not come back. The treatment of their waiters is perfect. Wheelchair accessibility: We had to stay at the entrance, there is a big step. Bad"
Restaurante Tortuga,"We had Valentines dinner here and it was a wonderful experience. We have never had a 6 course meal before and the Tortuga staff made it the best. They answered all of our questions about the food. When we visit Barcelona again, Tortuga will be a spot to revisit again."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Shiitake and cheese arancini - amazing, the best Sweet dreams (dessert) - surprising and delicious Mushroom rice - very good flavor but the rice was not ideal. The turtle egg had too much sauce, the flavor of the egg and mushrooms was lost. We also ordered the burrata but I wasnt convinced by the dill flavor. and the egg Vegetarian options: There was plenty to choose from."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Le personnel au petit soin avec nous, nous avons dine au tortuga lors de la Saint Valentin et franchement le menu etait vraiment incroyable ! Je pense lun des meilleurs restaurants que lont a fait ! Une pepite, vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermes Merci encore pour laccueil"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Creative cuisine and very delicious food, excellent customer service and a super pleasant atmosphere to enjoy with those we love. Congratulations to the Tortuga team for their great service. Greetings"

Restaurante Tortuga,"Family dinner, 5/5 delicious Spanish food, wine & atmosphere!"
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,"Thanks a lot to Guillermo and kitchen staff for the incredible experience! We will definitely return, service was very professional and food out of this world. The salmon was done to absolute perfection"
Restaurante Tortuga,"The best thing about the restaurant is the willingness of the waiters, but they dont have a job. The food tries to be creative, but it is not well achieved, the allergens are not well classified. The portions are very small, the price is disproportionate"
Restaurante Tortuga,"The food is good and the quality of the product is noticeable, but it doesnt provide anything different or special. The portions are minimal, the main dishes look like starters but are good as a main. I can say that almost  17 for a chicken-filled puff pastry the size of a dessert seems outrageous to me (and it only had the lid of puff pastry). Its one thing to charge for a good product and another thing to abuse it."
Restaurante Tortuga,"We ate super delicious, the kitchen is very well integrated into the dining room so that we can enjoy watching how they cook the dishes we have ordered. Pleasant space and extraordinary service. Very happy and satisfied."
Restaurante Tortuga,"One of the places I enjoyed most in Barcelona. A lot of attention to details, with fresh ingredients as if its all made in-house and on the spot. We enjoyed all the dishes, from the starters to the deserts."
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,"Where to start, the service was wonderful, very VERY friendly and pleasant! The place is cozy and very tasteful, with lights and exposed brick very intimate and pleasant. And the cherry on top, the Food is SPECTACULAR, the flavor, the texture, the presentation all impeccable. Highly recommended! Now we are Frequent customers for sure!!!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Surprisingly pleasant experience considering the location. Reasonably priced, well-prepared, and tasty food with great service in multiple languages. I see the same dishes we had have drawn mixed reviews in the past, but at least today it was all good. Big thanks to the staff for hosting us!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Fabulous, everything exquisite and a respectful and calm environment."
Restaurante Tortuga,Small and cozy. Very good food
Restaurante Tortuga,"All perfect! The food was delicious, highlighting the sirloin! Seeing how well they work in the kitchen is very nice. The waiter was super kind and friendly. Small but very cozy and recommended restaurant! If we return to Bcn, I will return for sure! Dietary restrictions: All allergens are indicated on the menu. Gluten-free options!"
Restaurante Tortuga,Amazing restaurant - the mushroom risotto croquette and the burrata were the highlights! The staff are very friendly and will take good care of you :)
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,The food was delicious! With a very fast service
Restaurante Tortuga,"All really very good and at a very good price. Delicious arancini, a vice, all of Barcelona talks about them. The service is very friendly and professional, both at the bar and in the kitchen. Truly a must Vegetarian options: There is a vegan menu that my niece has ordered several times and it is delicious like the rest of the dishes. Parking: There is a parking lot about 100 meters from the premises. Kid-friendliness: There is no problem going with small children, and they can be in the premises peacefully."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Today I went to the place, the food is good, but for what they charge and the amount they serve it seemed very expensive, little variety, very few dishes and they do not have everything they offer on the menu, I consider that there are better options, better served and at a more affordable cost."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Excellent service, the arancini is unmissable."
Restaurante Tortuga,Very delicious dishes
Restaurante Tortuga,L un des meilleurs plats jamais goutes . La glace a la pistache est une tuerie
Restaurante Tortuga,"The countrys language, Catalan, is non-existent on the website and on the menu it is treated as a joke in very bad taste"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Had a lovely dinner here with 2 people. Great atmosphere and music selection, attentive staff and great dedication to lovely dishes. Loved the combination of smaller and larger dishes, vegetarian and non-veg options and overal flow of the menu. Everything was served with great attention to detail!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Cute little restaurant in the heart of Barcelona. William took great care of my partner and I. We were able to just crash there for hours and were able to enjoy the croquettes, cocktails (the mojito was fantastic), and main dishes. The salmon was absolutely great. The dessert menu was also delicious. We might be back soon  just to enjoy the atmosphere"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Came here for dinner on our last night in Barcelona. It was very, very delicious, and I was healed by the taste that Japanese people like. The staff was friendly and it was a great way to end our trip. The recommended dishes I ate were the chicken cutlet and the mushroom rice."
Restaurante Tortuga,Great desserts!!!
Restaurante Tortuga,"The food was delicious, but the portions are ridiculous for the price. If you go, make sure you have a lot of money or not much hunger."
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,Petit restaurant avec cuisine ouverte. Plats gastronomique et excellents produits frais. Excellente ambiance. Dietary restrictions: Allergenes indiques
Restaurante Tortuga,"The waiter Victor treated us wonderfully and the food was excellent. We loved the starters, especially the truffled egg. Just a small recommendation for the main ones that could be a little more filling. I will be back"
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,Excellent food and wines
Restaurante Tortuga,"Small place with open kitchen. You go out with a little cooking smell on you but never mind. The bacon with bok choy is a must try. Excellent red wine sangria. Not cheap, online... we really liked it. To try!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Very tasty food and exceptional service. Very friendly and professional owner, treats you in a personalized and attentive way, I recommend it! Perhaps, as a suggestion, you could serve the chicken puff pastry with some garnish and the braised meat dish perhaps include a slightly larger amount of food. But again, excellent restaurant."
Restaurante Tortuga,"I was surprised when I arrived, I didnt have a reservation but the attention from the beginning was spectacular. The dishes are wonderful, the salmon is delicious! The truth is that everything we ordered was spectacular, the prices are very good"

Restaurante Tortuga,Great restaurant!! Amazing food and overall experience. Totally recommend!
Restaurante Tortuga,Super nice space. THE BEST HAM CROQUETTE I HAVE EVER TASTED.
Restaurante Tortuga,"Extremely tasty! We had creamy chicken, teriyaki salmon and steak. The desert was   i really do recommend its good stuff   good good good you can even see the food being cooked in front of you. As a picky eater i was sceptical at first but it turned out to be great!"
Restaurante Tortuga,Food is not bad but not something special. The prices are a bit high and the portoons are small.

Restaurante Tortuga,Great waiters! And the delicious food
Restaurante Tortuga,"Beautiful discovery  . We went to this restaurant after reading some reviews, we booked with TheFork, taking advantage of a discount. Truly superlative dishes. We ordered the bao with pork belly (a must try), the salmon with taraiaki sauce (really excellent), also the croquetas a must try. You can find traditional dishes revisited in a contemporary key. A stones throw from the Ciutadella park, very kind staff. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"The best food we had in Spain during our entire trip. 10/10 service, drinks were unreal. Tried multiple mains and desert was perfectly done. Travelling from Canada and still think about this meal honestly."
Restaurante Tortuga,
Restaurante Tortuga,"Very tasty, imaginative, balanced and lovingly prepared dishes."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Excellent experience! We booked with TheFork so we also benefited from a discount, however the prices are still in line with the quality. These are traditional dishes, revisited in a contemporary key. Really interesting ideas. Well done!"
Restaurante Tortuga,I didnt know him. I saw it by chance on Google and it did not disappoint. The food is amazing. The place is super cozy and the attention is very very friendly.
Restaurante Tortuga,"Excellent in everything! Above all, the attention makes you feel super good    the food is a 10!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"I would have loved to take photos because everything is spectacular. When you have a limited letter, it is important to do everything right. Everything was SPECTACULAR. I congratulate you. Other level"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Great presentation and menu selection but no so great execution. - Chicken katsu: looked great and the sauce was nice but the chicken itself was tasteless and dry. - Pork belly bao: was actually really good, especially buns. - Pulled beef: clearly not cooked long enough so it wasn t really  pulled - Cheese rise: amazing, very creamy and with generous portioned of broiled goats cheese."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Small but cozy atmosphere, delicious food, very original and different flavors. Open kitchen that adds a lot of charm to the experience. I recommend!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Dishes with a lot of love, tasty and original. Good service, fast and polite. Quality price, reasonable."

Restaurante Tortuga,Wonderful environment. Food was impeccable. Excellent service from start to finish. Highly recommended.
Restaurante Tortuga,"Good and original food. However, I have the feeling that they have raised prices and that they are looking for the foreign audience. Any more local links would be appreciated."
Restaurante Tortuga,

Restaurante Tortuga,"Nice atmosphere, service ok, value for money food wasnt right. Hard penne floating in oil, lots of salt on a thin slice of mozzarella. Small portion for 17 . No risk of repetition. A pity."

Restaurante Tortuga,I havent enjoyed a meal so much in a long time. To eat slowly and enjoy. Very friendly waiters. 100% recommended
Restaurante Tortuga,"Exquisite food, unmissable dessert. What a challenge to have an open kitchen, admirable. Vegetarian options: Unmissable eggplant, the balsamic is crazy"
Restaurante Tortuga,"Cozy place with quality food. We especially liked the croquettes, the eggplant tempura and the bacon baos."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Restaurant discovered by chance while looking for a good place for tapas in Barcelona. Small but very well-kept place with open kitchen (always a plus for us!). All the dishes we tried were very good: ham croquettes, arancini, crostini with cheese and courgettes, patatas bravas, bao with pork belly (superlative!), assortment of cured meats and cheeses, beef stew with vegetables, lemon risotto with cheese goat cheese (really top!) and chocolate and lemon desserts. The house mojito is also delicious and special! Thanks in particular to the guys who run the place, extremely nice, friendly and interested in our feedback. Thanks also for the tequila, really good!"
Restaurante Tortuga,"A place that will surprise you with everything, it is worth visiting"
Restaurante Tortuga,Excellent service!!
Restaurante Tortuga,"Insanely good food, the lunch menu was so well thought out, everything balanced well and delicious. Especially loved the malt cake with figs."
Restaurante Tortuga,"Look, I could write a big story about how they do amazing stuff with flavour and what not but I wont be able to cover it. Just go here with someone, get one of whatever is being served each, and share. Get starters, mains and deserts. Just do it. You wont regret it. Absolutely lovely staff too."

Vegetarian options: Stuffed tomato was absolutely delicious!"
Restaurante Tortuga,Top quality
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"Its really delicious   I ordered it by glovo after making two attempts at other restaurants and I kept getting an error. I didnt try it. I did a Google search and it seems like it was something about the Connection, although later it occurred to me that maybe the other restaurants werent operating, or the address didnt cover my area. Although its strange because one of them has already brought me home to my ksa, but I ordered it by deliveroo... it may be that they have different restaurants... well the case, as well as who doesnt want the Thing I said: lets see if in another restaurant works, because I really wanted to eat something delicious and healthy and I also received an email from Glovo giving me a  5 bonus     and I wanted to take advantage of it! Once it happened to me with deliveroo, but I had to place a minimum order of  30     and no that made me very angry   what a discount that is  they force you to spend  30 to give you a mini discount! No! I refused, it was beyond what for me is a discount     I loved Glovo because the minimum order was  10 and that was within my mental and monetary possibilities    The first one I saw was The Fresh Poke and Yay, a bowl with salmon,    mango and   made my eyes go crazy, its called Philsalmon Poke, small size,  9.90  I added two chocolate mochis for  2 in total, applying the discount, it came out to  11.49     one excellent investment in me     today I wanted salmon, although I almost never eat meat or animals anymore, I like to say that I am FlexiteraNa! Most of the time I eat more vegetarian or vegan style   but I leave some space    for those whims that sometimes my body or my head asks of me and the truth is that it makes me very happy   that flexibility       The flavors of my Poke Ugh, I loved them, the only thing I thought was that the little one was very small but like when I ordered it, there wasnt any photo to give me an idea of the size because I couldnt assess it... although at least it looks good. I loved the mochos, especially the flavor of the filling, super creamy, with that hint of chocolate on top  They brought my order quickly! Luis, A kinder and funnier man, I felt like giving him a hug   although I didnt, this Covid-19 thing has us crossed arms. I dont know if Ill see it again but it left a nice memory in my heart! Glovo a round of applause   for that Glover Number 10   well I think thats all for today! If you ask, tell me what you think, you can find me on networks like khassilda, where I share the most is Twitter and Tik Tok, YouTube, but Im also on Instagram or Facebook and lbry! Better said, Im in a thousand places hahaha I lose my temper sometimes        but I have fun, which is whats important!

The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"They kicked me out even though it was open because it decided to close early, 0 desire to work"
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Delicious poke bowl for a fair price. I ordered a small California poke bowl for around  9 and it was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and tasty. The shop has a cute vibe and atmosphere with comfortable seating. The service was great with no issues! Highly recommend for people who want an affordable healthy meal in Barcelona.
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"I came again today. Always very good. This time bad. New Latin waitress very polite but she doesnt understand and very small and very fair amounts this time compared to the last time. Its not worth it anymore. I ordered the small bowl and they didnt even put it in half. A shame because he came often. By the way, there was no paper in the bathroom to dry yourself. The premises being empty and 3 people working."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,They are not fresh products and it is expensive
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"We were there all alone in the afternoon, we took a medium bowl for   14.00 and it was plentiful and very tasty. We can only recommend it."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"I have tried several poke bowl establishments (although I am not an expert), and this one is good: good ingredients, with a lot of variety, although some typical ones, like I think they were mango and avocado, come with an extra charge, which added to the fact that at least The large portion didnt seem that big to me, I raised the price a bit too much. Good service, friendly and fast, and the place is nice and with some space to eat. It has a good location on the same diagonal, a few blocks from Paseo de Gracia."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,We ordered through Glovo and I asked for assemble your bowl and mine had brown rice mixed with sushi rice when I ordered it with whole grain + quinoa. I ordered cream cheese that was conspicuous by its absence and I ordered double salmon and it was very little. The other poke arrived without spicy mayo or crispy onion. We will not order from The fresh Poke Diagonal again.
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,The service is very good and delicious pokes! Thank you very much always for the 10 treatment of Lali and Judit!!

The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"The delivery service is a shame! A fraud. I spent 21 euros on a large bowl and I got less than half of it. Almost empty... the truth is, a disaster. How angry it makes me. Because when you go to the store they make it good for you... but here of course, you just see them and they give you half of it. THANK YOU"
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Absolutely amazing poke! Very flavorful and the employee was very kind.
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"The food is okay, the staff could be a little more polite. I left without eating because there was no change and they didnt want to give me any solution about it."

The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"I had never tried Poke Bowls before and the truth is that it surprised me, the one I ate was delicious. In Fresh Poke you can choose between pokes from the menu or make your own, if you dont like any of the foods in the Poke from the menu you can also change it. You have the possibility of making a menu (Poke + Gyozas or Soup or Dessert + Drink) or choosing the Poke and drink separately They have a wide variety of products, it is difficult not to find one or more that you like. The place is good, small but good distribution of the tables. The worst thing and for which I give it 4 stars, is the waiting time until the Poke is ready, at least on the day I went, more than 30 minutes of waiting, I know that it is normal for that reason. They should hire one more person and those who are there should go a little faster. Comment that the attention, yes, once they attended to us it was correct."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"We ordered two menus, it is well worth ordering them. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. The girl is very kind. Both the gyozas and the desserts were very delicious. The medium size is enough to fill you up. Vegetarian options: They have vegetarian options in the bowl to taste with a variety of options Wheelchair accessibility: It has a ramp at the entrance"
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"Quality product, first class service, it was time to eat healthy and start taking care of yourself a little more, the explosion of flavors of natural products is priceless, I ate a  14 menu and I ended up satisfied and I enjoyed every moment of the combination of the ingredients with the suggestion of the shop assistant Klaudia, who at all times never ceases to surprise me with her professional quality, to control the entire number of consumers that we were in the premises, a highly recommended place and if not you can also request it by GLOVO!!"
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"It seems to be a good place to buy something to take away. Its not really a place to sit down and eat. Unfortunately, I couldnt try the food because they close more than half an hour earlier than whats stated on Google Maps. I arrived at 22:30 after a 20-minute walk and they didnt want to serve me because, according to the staff, the place closes earlier on Thursdays. Please change the public opening hours on Maps. I wouldnt want to file a complaint over such a trivial matter."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"Quality product, fast and healthy!"
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Good place to eat
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"We arrived at 4:20 p.m. and they didnt let us sit down to eat (we were two people), Googles schedule says it closes at 5 p.m."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Very good and the girls very kind
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Adequate price quality
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"It doesnt seems a poke... The rice is not the right, is the western regular. Came with a lot of (seems to be industrialized) sauce that took all the taste. The ingredients were tasteless. The food wasnt too bad, eatable... It is just not good. Better go to another poke place nearby, maybe one that is not part of a chain."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Great poke bowls! You can choose a menu or customize the poke. They serve you super fast and guide you on which ingredient or sauce works best. Very friendly and efficient.
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Almost excellent because sometimes they take a long time.
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"Very good quality, fresh products. Very good atmosphere."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,Fresh fresh and very testy And obviously very healthy
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,"The place is quiet and cozy, and the food is very good, from the poke bowl itself to the dessert. What I do have to blame is the service, which was correct but quite slow, although as compensation for this they did not charge me for the prawns (they have a supplement) nor for the coffee. They need one more person to speed up customer service."
The Fresh Poke Diagonal,
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","This is a burger and chips, but its a great burger and chips place. Lovely, friendly staff, great sangria (extra points for that!) And the burger was Amazing!"
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Best place in Barcelona.

"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Everything super good
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","Two euros more per frikandel for sauce,  5.75 for one with little sauce. Frikandel special heavily overpriced, crazy. Dos euros mas por frikandel para la salsa, 5.75 euros for one piece of salsa. Frikandel especial muy caro, loco. 2 euros extra per frikandel to make it special, crazy, who pays six euros for a special frikandel hahahaha. If you want to pay 80 euros for a Dutch drink and a snack, youre in the right place. You pay at least 20 euros for sauce :)"
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","Good atmosphere, delicious food and great service. I would repeat"
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","I went on February 2, everything was very good but that day they did not accept card payment."
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","Edited after the owners response. When we went to the bar on Friday 02.02 the waitress (a Venezuelan girl) told us that only cash payment is accepted. I mean you dont know what happens in your own bar or do you mean Im lying?!!! I liked it a lot - they have authentic Dutch snacks. The portions are large and the place is quite atmospheric. They have a wide variety of beers and alcohol. Although not all types of gin, for example Seagrams, did not even have pink Indian port. The service is friendly but I gave 4 stars because they do not accept cards"

"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Service a little slow and ribs nothing out of this world. I dont think well go back. Im not saying its bad but there are many other better places to go.
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","The place is nice, the food is very delicious and the service of the waitress who served us was perfect, with recommendations and great kindness, the 4 stars are, because unfortunately we had to witness, like, a drunk man, who was not even consuming In the establishment, he attacked the waitress with bad words and apart from that he came to physical contact by pushing her, he sat at the bar and right there he bothered her in a super uncomfortable way for both customers and the waitress who does not have to put up with this type of treatment from anyone, unfortunately it seems that this man is a regular in the place, the truth is it is very uncomfortable and very sad to see how such an interesting place with such good things and such good service allows this type of behavior from a man who should having entry prohibited, thats what the right of admission is for, I hope they do something about it, for the good of the atmosphere of the place and for the good of the girl who does her job well is being intimidated, by this man without anyone doing something about."

"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","In Barcelona, being served in German by a Dutchman from Nimjegen and then eating the best spare ribs... awesome..."
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","The service is very slow. I was unlucky that there was a problem in the kitchen and only the tapas part was available. I understand that this can happen sometimes. But, dont come and tell me this when I had already ordered something to drink. Lets call it first line and thats it, Ill come another time. After today, I dont know if Ill come again. I asked for some available tapas that were there. My goodness, how long they took... some simple nachos and some fries took their time... I note that the coulant I ate for dessert was delicious. Therefore I imagine that the food must be delicious in general. But the service is still very slow."
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Cl watched Feyenoord-Celtic.. great thnx. definitely come back.

"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","I love to praise a job well done, the dedication and the quality of the places I visit, but in this restaurant something happened to me that surprised me. We ordered a hamburger that supposedly comes with cured meat (it must be said that we ordered it without having the slightest idea) and the owner came out to tell us that he couldnt serve it, because the type of meat that the hamburger had was out of stock. That we had to choose between the many other options that the menu gives. And I thought Chapo, what a decent and honest gentleman, really anywhere else they would have served us any other type of hamburger meat and we probably hadnt realized it. It is very nice to know that not only is it a place where the food is great, the place is very nice, the service is exceptional and it is also run by honest people. Congratulations, without a doubt when I return to Barcelona I will repeat. Thank you very much for your attention."
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",It is our second time here...Blass service and attention is excellent. We have felt at home. The ribs are delicious and the Barcelona burger is very good. On their Instagram social network they report on promotions for those who like to repeat.
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Very nice staff and the ribbs are amazing
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Popped my head in here with the boys for a casual dinner. We all knew from googling they specialized in ribs. Easily the best ribs any of us have ever consumed. Fall off the bone tender & the sauce is wonderful. Highly reccomend for anyone visiting Barcelona! Hope to be back one day!
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona",Best ribs I ve ever had. Can t stop thinking about them. Incredible.

I will return to try the ribs and the burgers, which they say are magnificent. Perfect place to watch soccer games and experience them with the atmosphere there is. The staffs attention was very good, especially Blas and the waitress who didnt know her name but was super helpful."

"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","Bar to have a drink but not to eat, I wouldnt repeat either the burgers or the ribs, in fact I wont go again."
"Bar-Restaurant Amsterdam, Barcelona","Bad experience, its a bar, nothing to do with a restaurant, the ribs are dry, the potatoes are soggy, the salad is tasteless, we ordered a jug of summer red wine that was pure ice and also has a terrible taste, I wont return to this place, no I recommend it."

Casa Bangla,"Both the quality and the service is that of a luxury restaurant, they have treated us and advised us very well within their extensive menu and there are also many options for both vegan, vegetarian and people who are lactose intolerant. Very tasty food and fast, friendly and attentive service. We will surely return! Vegetarian options: Great variety of vegetarian and vegan options! Dietary restrictions: They have the allergens on the menu perfectly indicated, as well as the level of spiciness of the dishes."
Casa Bangla,"Pretty authentic Indian food place. We were satisfied with everything they gave us, although I think it is a bit expensive. Vegetarian options: They have a lot of vegetarian base, which you can eat as is or add meat/seafood according to your preferences."
Casa Bangla,All very rich
Casa Bangla,"Excellent food and quality products. You can taste the authentic flavor of Indian food. We tried the tandoori grill with delicious marinated meats and tikka masala, as well as spectacular butter chicken! Very neat and cozy place and unbeatable service."
Casa Bangla,"This restaurant has a very authentic selection of Bangladeeshi food items. Price is reasonable but quality is highly maintained. Nice seating arrangement and service, both are satisfying."

Casa Bangla,"Excellent service from the first moment, very clean cutlery and premises, excellent food except for the chicken, which I found too dry for my taste. The curry and garlic bread very good."
Casa Bangla,"I discovered Casa Bangla by chance and without having tried Indian food before I ventured to try it. Now that I have tried Indian food I can say that I really liked it and that I will try many more options. At Casa Bangla I tried the Korma with chicken, the nan bread and the vegetable samosas. The waiter who served me was very friendly, attentive and explained any questions you had. As a point of improvement I will say that they could renew the letter by laminating it or in digital format since they give it on cardboard and they are a little worn. For everything else, I was very happy with the food and the service. Thank you."
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,The site is highly recommended. It ends up being a little more expensive than I thought but the food was very delicious. We tried the beregenas as a starter and they really surprised us! We also loved Rogan Josh

Casa Bangla,"One of the best places to eat in Barcelona, if you like Indian and Pakistan spiced food. Quality is high, and theres a wide chose of meat, fish and special dishes. Staff is kind, smiley, very pleasant and friendly, ready to suggest what courses fit better your tastes. You HAVE to try it!"
Casa Bangla,We went to celebrate a birthday and it was a beautiful experience! All the people there were super friendly and the food was delicious and abundant! Thank you!
Casa Bangla,"The food was great, we will definitely come to eat again."
Casa Bangla,"Overall satisfied: authentic Indian food very well prepared. I ordered Labrador with lamb, super tasty in its cast iron casserole to keep warm. One of the best Naan bread (garlic) I have ever tasted. Unbeatable service. Things to improve: A lot of smoke in the room coming from the kitchen. It should be better. Price somewhat high, rice is not included in the main, and for that price it should be. I recommend it and I will surely return :)"
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"Excellent restaurant, very clean and with very good food and really respectful and attentive staff. Highly recommended"

Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,Good Indian food. Friendly staff. I miss chai tea
Casa Bangla,"Overall a really nice restaurant to try authentic Indian dish. Although the name suggests it may be a Bengali restaurant, most of the items are non-Bengali. We tried bhuna chicken and it was delicious. If you can t handle very hot food, then please don t have it. The chicken pakora was more of a chicken cutlet but they were delicious as well. The price is reasonable. The restaurant is in the interior of the area, so you may have to walk for 5 min to find your nearest metro or bus stop."
Casa Bangla,Super friendly service and best Indian food i had outside India. We came back three times during our stay in Barcelona. My boyfriend even wanted to buy takeaway and take it to berlin.
Casa Bangla,Best Indian in bcn
Casa Bangla,"The food doesn t taste bad, definitely not clean good luck with ur stomach the next day"

Casa Bangla,Dirty dirty dirty!!!! Cockroaches are all over the  restaurant  and most of the waiters dont understand Spanish or English. They take the trash out of peoples houses too. What disgusting  people   they better close it. Garbage nothing more.
Casa Bangla,Warm with spirit and very good food and service.
Casa Bangla,Weve eaten Indian food all over the world and this was one of the best meals we ever had.   Absolutely lovely and highly recommended.   Were only in Barcelona for 4 nights and glad we found this place on day 1.  Well be visiting again!
Casa Bangla,Delicious food and very attentive service. The portions are generous and at a good price. We will repeat
Casa Bangla,"Attentive, fast and kind staff. We tasted some classic dishes, all very good and at a more than honest price. Super recommended!"
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"First time & I can t wait to go again! Good food, great service and beautiful ambience"
Casa Bangla,"Family atmosphere inside and nice to eat. Living nearby we always ask for pick up and in 15 they have it done. The waiters are very friendly, the food EXCELLENT Vegetarian options: Perfect for vegetarians like any Indian food, the menu lists all the ingredients and the spiciness level Kid-friendliness: You can always see families with children and couples"
Casa Bangla,"After a busy day we wanted to eat Indian food and chose this restaurant because of the good reviews. The ambience and service were actually appealing - but unfortunately our individual requests for spiciness were not taken into account - this was specified for each menu. Not surprisingly, all of the menus were too spicy for our taste, so we couldnt really enjoy the food, which was a shame! We often eat Indian food but here it seemed like everything was already pre-cooked and the flexibility in the kitchen was lost!"
Casa Bangla,"Food was good, tasted nice, we had naan. A lamb dish and a chicken dish. And something with cheese, they were all tasty! We both ate the same, But later on we ended up being nauseous, It started with a stomach ache and later on vomiting. Im not trying to bad mouth the restaurant ive seen decent amount of reviews, but the fact we  ended up vomiting after 30min of eating cant be coincidence. There must be a simple  reason for that. This means although the  outside ambiance looks good and clean, looks can be deceiving. Im sure there is like a  e-coli infection  which means their hygiene isn t great or lets say the best. But what you should expect as a customer is that we shouldn t at-least get sick. This is the worse. I feel like they ain t washing their hands properly. Or not wearing gloves. Or either the meat is not proper cooked or the meat is so old that the sauces are covering its smell."
Casa Bangla,"The attitude of the waiter is very good and educational, and almost all the dishes we have tried are delicious and delicious, the price is reasonable, even cheap if you are a group to eat together, this store is worth trying!"
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"Amazing food, probably the best Indian food Ive ever had. Great service. Highly recommended."
Casa Bangla,"Very good quality food. Mix of Indian and Bangladeshi. If you re in the mood for Bangladeshi food then ask for beef bhuna extra spicy, white rice and rezala"
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"I cant fault it. Great, great. I have come three times and all three times very well."

Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"One of the best Indian restaurants in Barcelona. Excellent service, big portions and absolutely delicious food!"
Casa Bangla,"It was quite a surprise to discover this establishment, the food was very delicious and generous in quantity. We ordered 1 starter, 2 dishes with a side dish and we couldnt finish them. They very kindly offered us to wrap them to take away. The waiters are very friendly and patient explaining the menu to us, there are many options and I recommend taking a look at the Google photos before going. The place is not big but not so small that people cannot pass by without rubbing against the tables, because of the area that many of you will know that the reception is low or non-existent. Without a doubt a place to visit if you like Indian food and of course we will return PS: Make a reservation just in case, it fills up quickly! With TheFork there are usually promotions, take advantage of them!"
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,Excellent place and a delicious menu. Excellent atention
Casa Bangla,"The staff are really friendly and the service was great (hence the 3 stars) The food wasn't quite up to scratch sadly. Firstly there was a hair under the papadum which was quite an off putting start to the meal. The onion baji wasn't great and was more like a pakora. Maybe they ran out of paneer as the saag paneer did not contain paneer, it was feta cheese or something similar which didn't really go and is really disappointing when you are expecting paneer. Indian restaurants are difficult to find in Barcelona but I hate to say there are a few much better than this."
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"We tried Salmon curry, it was very delicias. Service was also very good."
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,It just wasnt good
Casa Bangla,Good food and they are super friendly
Casa Bangla,"The best korma Ive ever had. Did I say EVER? Well, thats what I meant. Ive had a few, because being this crazy Finnish Swede, I almost always try the korma whenever I try a new indian restaurant. I was here with my 12 friends and every single one said that the food was amazing! Maybe not the coziest restaurant, but the service was excellent! If I come back to Barcelona, this will be one of the first restaurants I will walk to. Regardless where I stay, I will walk. Its so worth it! So go there! I will pay for your food if you dont like it. Or maybe not. But if I could, I wouldve. Peace yall!"
Casa Bangla,"Always very delicious food! Good portions, I highly recommend the salmon Rogan Josh."
Casa Bangla,The restaurant serves good dishes. The servers are very welcoming and give good advice. We strongly recommend
Casa Bangla,"Third time I eat at this restaurant, it is always a 10! We work very close to the site and say that it is the best restaurant without a doubt. Food 10, brutal staff! With the fork discount even better."
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,
Casa Bangla,"I was left without an Indian restaurant in Sant Antoni- Eixample esquerrra when Namaste and Syra closed, now we have finally found one in Raval that is much more than the height, treats affable very welcoming, cassola food especially perfect for who likes spicy contrasts in the most indigenous dishes of India. The friendliness and the home-like treatment, not to mention the delicious food, the best. Good quantities at a good price. We will return without hesitation!!"
Casa Bangla,"The photos dont judge the food, its very good! I dont know if the service or the food was better. Super attentive staff. The dishes are very generous and the prices are fair. The staff still takes care to understand the menu well, because for those who dont usually eat a lot of Indian food, it can be a little confusing. You can share dishes and try more flavors. If you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, they are very careful. We left the restaurant super satisfied with the food and the experience, both those who dont eat meat and those who do."

I was fortunate enough to have lunch here during their dessert and wine-themed week, and each dessert I tried was spectacular and excellently paired with wine.

Starting with the service, the staff was attentive to us at all times, especially Hector, super nice and attentive. For the food we opted for the Pica Pica Menu and everything was delicious, I ordered the second sirloin of old beef with Malvasia sauce and Part of what was exquisite, melts in the mouth. And the finishing touch was the desserts, an assortment of pastries by Claudio Llundayn that were impressive. In short, a perfect dinner, in a perfect restaurant. Many thanks to all the staff."

I know I should possible see other places as well and not eat at same place when you visit for such short time but coming back next weekend to see what else they have"

I would highlight the good ham and croquettes on this menu. Frankly recommend it whether you live in Barcelona or are visiting.
Pelai,"Our server Irini was wonderful, personable,. and sweet. She was very helpful and genuine. The duck was incredible and full of flavor. My partner had the lamb and said it was the best lamb hes ever had. And hes had a lot of lamb! Even the gluten-free bread was incredible and moist, a rare rare find. Everything was simply delicious from the croquettes to the sweet little array of desserts. The whole experience was quite a lovely treat. We highly recommend!"
Pelai,"Chic restaurant in the mid-price segment. We had a menu that was really filling and the drinks were included. The food was very good but on the spicy side, it definitely shouldnt have been more salty or spicy. Meat was on point, both medium and sagniant. Paella was good but borderline. Pleasant restaurant with good service."
Pelai,
Pelai,"Located on the legendary Carrer Tallers you will find this oasis of peace and elegance that is the Pelai restaurant. The atmosphere is very calm and pleasant, the food is exquisite and the professional team that attends to you is excellent. A place to return to."

Vegan Food Heaven,Delicious vegan food for fair prices
Vegan Food Heaven,"I dont know how this place has so many positive reviews because I dont see how our experience could be a one off. Having just arrived in the city we thought wed hit up the beach. Getting hungry and finding this place just around the corner with great reviews I thought, perfect. The food was bland at best, and the patatas bravas? Awful! Roast potatoes served with tomato ketchup and plain mayonnaise! I made a point of ordering patatas bravas at every other restaurant we visited as if to reinforce just how bad these were. And to serve with ketchup?! Awful experience!"
Vegan Food Heaven,Great vegan food
Vegan Food Heaven,Awesome vegan food with a lot of options for tapas and side dishes. Staff was really friendly and good in English for the conversation. Recommended!

Thank you!! Kid-friendliness: It is a restaurant that ranges from single people, couples with and without children, families, groups. Family atmosphere. Wheelchair accessibility: A friend of ours is in a wheelchair, and it is possible to enter the restaurant."
Vegan Food Heaven,Parking: FREE (blue zone) from September to April
Vegan Food Heaven,"We do not understand the ratings on this site. Totally mediocre. A menu of the day cooked without any grace, without any flavor and all of very debatable quality. Neither the location, nor the menu, nor the portions, nor the service is anywhere to be found. I dont recommend it at all. Any other option in the area will be a better option."
Vegan Food Heaven,Its a simple place with tasty food and kind stuff. Vegetarian options: Everything is vegan and really tasty. Food : 5/5 |
Vegan Food Heaven,"The food was good, large portions and relatively cheap. I recommend the tali set, even without the menu of the day you can eat enough. The service was average, not very pleasant and didnt speak English. The decor is simple, but the interior is very dark and not very pleasant."
Vegan Food Heaven,"Excellent atmosphere and service, good and vegan food at a reasonable price, the menu was great"
Vegan Food Heaven,
Vegan Food Heaven,
Vegan Food Heaven,"The food was below average. Very bland and little taste. The waiter hardly spoke to us. Brought us three of four tapas we ordered without telling us that the fourth was still taking. After 20 minutes the last tapas dish came when we had finished the rest of our food. When we said we were finished eating and full, evil looks came from the kitchen."
Vegan Food Heaven,"Unfortunately rather disappointing. The food was very bland, hardly seasoned."
Vegan Food Heaven,The place has a rather harsh climate. Nice and fast service. Very good and large dishes at an affordable price. A glass of Sangria for  5.50. We recommend!
Vegan Food Heaven,
Vegan Food Heaven,"Excellent place to eat. Extensive menu and fast, friendly service. The best is the vegan paella, very delicious!! It is very well located 10 min. from the Poblenou cemetery."

Vegan Food Heaven,We went to dinner in a quiet place. Very good food with lots of flavor. I recommend the seitan stew with rice. Without a doubt we will repeat.
Vegan Food Heaven,"Economical menu for 10.50, very correct. The tempura mushrooms are very good and the quiche too. Vegetarian options: All vegan"
Vegan Food Heaven,"The food was very good, the quantities were generous, the price very reasonable. I tried a menu of the day that, although it had several options that included two courses (an appetizer and a main course), also included dessert, a bottle of water or a glass of wine, and a basket of bread. All for  10.50. There are other a la carte options such as Seitan steak and basmati rice. There are many vegan options. The bathroom is super clean. The warm atmosphere without excess noise. Recommended."
Vegan Food Heaven,"Indian food with a Spanish twist. Gazpacho was good, and they had a spicy tofu with rice that was fantastic. Good choice if youre passing by."
Vegan Food Heaven,Very delicious food and lemonades
Vegan Food Heaven,
Vegan Food Heaven,Excellent service! Nepali run with a wide variety of food. Momo are the highlights highly recommend. Excellent hospitality. A must visit especially for vegans/vegetarians!

Vegan Food Heaven,Amazing and authentic Nepali food! Large portions. Best chai - freshly ground ginger.
Vegan Food Heaven,"It is a Nepali food restaurant, with a very extensive menu of natural fruit juices. I tried the MoMo which are dumplings, they were delicious. And the lentil pancakes, very crunchy. With that for one person more than enough"
Vegan Food Heaven,Really nice food and great service
Vegan Food Heaven,Polenta and black beans were great! Hummus was good too. Got it all for 10.50 under the menu del dia. Service was standard (except for a brief misunderstanding when it was borderline hostile lol) Great food for a good price

Vegan Food Heaven,"Amazing food and juices, try it even if you are non-vegan!"
Vegan Food Heaven,"Great food (recommended tofu with rice and mushrooms), good service, location is OK and prices are fair. Recommended if you want to have a vegan meal"
Vegan Food Heaven,"When it comes to a menu that has something for every vegan taste, Vegan Food Heaven has you covered. The menu is extensive but not too overwhelming, and the portions are ideal to share with a fellow foodie. The food comes out fresh and is full of flavor. I highly recommend trying a couple of starters and a main dish to enjoy the variety of flavors and textures. The burgers are especially filling and perfect for sharing, specifically the Vegan steak. The service is attentive and quick, and there is outdoor seating. The ambience of the restaurant is a little plain, but the quality of the food speaks for the place. Vegetarian options: The entire menu is vegan and veggie-friendly. Dietary restrictions: Allergens are clearly listed and there s options for vegan, veggie, and gluten-free. Wheelchair accessibility: The entrance is wheelchair-friendly."

Vegan Food Heaven,"The cheese wraps were super delicious, a bit spicy and the cheese n seitan combo was nice. And you get two big wraps, so the portion size is great! Also protein smoothie was pretty good. The only thing that was a bit lacking was the service."
Vegan Food Heaven,The food is incredible Vegetarian options: All Kid-friendliness: All good quality vegan

Vegan Food Heaven,"Excellent food and very attentive and friendly service. Everything fresh, freshly prepared, subtle flavors of authentic Nepalese cuisine. 100% recommended"
Vegan Food Heaven,I eat here often while in Barcelona - very good option during breaks as it is close to the Casino & beach.
Vegan Food Heaven,Great food in an unpromising location with an intermittent but typical Barcelona drain smell. The restaurant is set back from a fairly busy road in the suburbs so no particular evening out vibe going on. However the food was superb and accompanied by half-decent wine and good beer. Would thoroughly recommend!
Vegan Food Heaven,"I am not vegan and I like meat, but I have to admit that the food is very good, and it is also healthy. I went with a friend who is vegan."

Vegan Food Heaven,"Amazing vegan experience.  Best overall restaurant experience at the end of one week of vacation in Barcelona. We chose the daily menu (menu del dia) and tried the gazpacho, the mo:mo, the guacamole and both had the Thali . Wow!  Everything was delicious.  The white wine was very good. This is the best food you can get for your money.  The only thing to mention was the heat in the restaurant.  The restaurant is very clean and the service is exceptional.  Having found this restaurant earlier (this is our last evening in Barcelona) we would have been regulars since there are many tempting items on the menu."
Vegan Food Heaven,"We were looking for vegan food in Barcelona and found this gem just next to the beach. Great clean eating, vegan plant based and super affordable! Vegetarian options: Great vegan options!"
Vegan Food Heaven,"The food is rich and varied, but the waiters are quite rude. It is well priced and they dont take too long to serve."

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Food, very good, excellent service, I want to return, Varied, interesting cuisine."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Excellent dining experience. Trinxat, beans with cod and roasted chicken in the oven with apple and foie. All three out of 10. Fast and very efficient service. Very correct price"
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Good service and everything we ate was very good except for the baby octopus with onion which were rubbery. A mistake that counts but the rest is very good.
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Super delicious food, cozy place and charming staff The iaia macarons are sublime!"
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,excellent Catalan casserole cuisine by F Monraba.
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,All very good
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Degrading treatment towards a person with a disability, grotesque and lack of empathy. Food below expectations. I made a reservation for my disabled grandmother at 1:30 p.m. We had not yet arrived at 1:40 p.m. because we were a little slower with her. They called me to find out where we were. I told him that we would arrive in two minutes because we were accompanying my grandmother. So that they would know that what I was telling them was true, I went ahead and went straight to the restaurant. What I didnt expect was what I found: the restaurant chef and the waitress who answers the phone laughing that we were late because my grandmother was slow. The worst thing of all is that I confronted them because it did not fit into my head that a chef who was already around 60 years old would have such a grotesque attitude toward older people. And he didnt apologize. Of course I didnt want to discuss it with my family because only I had experienced that horrible experience. So we all sat at the table. About the food to say: nothing impressed us, we expected traditional food with a  plus  and different touch and we found simple dishes, without any twist and with a lack of cooking (hard). No one in the group ordered dessert, and for them to not order dessert means that their expectations were so low that they didnt want to bother anymore. We will definitely not return because of the service or the food. Its been a long time since Ive felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Homemade food to enjoy with friends. A party
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Great place served by great professionals
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"What a discovery in the Eixample! - Kitchen: a restaurant that offers dishes to resurrect, a tribute to traditional cuisine. Everything well executed and taken care of: aunt Enriquetas macarons are out of the ordinary. Very good chicken omelette. What I thought could be improved is the scallop croquette, although it wasnt bad, and the chuxo (loses texture when reheated). Also a nice touch is the starter green salad, which is a house call for all tables. - Informal, relaxed atmosphere. - Rations and prices from another era in the Eixample. Very good value for money. Grand Frank (Captain Haddock!)"
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Delicious authentic dishes, I recommend the cod in tomatoes and the meatballs in sepi sauce. Very good wine at normal prices, friendly staff, including the owner who serves customers. such a diamond in the rough."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"One of my other favorites; the escudella is wonderful; The cuiner is great, cultured and interested in continuing to learn and gain expertise; a luxury for diners The combination of interior and exterior terrace is great"

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Broth and stew Friday
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"It offers Catalan cuisine like Escudella on Fridays, it was delicious!!! The place is cozy with a curious decoration."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,IMPRESSIVE AND SPECTACULAR. The escudella they make on Fridays is delicious!! The service of 10! We will repeat for sure!!!!
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"We know Haddock from going there 3-4 times in the last 2 years. Proposal of good market product with the personal seal of Franc, chef and alma mater of the restaurant. On this occasion we were tempted to go there on a Friday to try their already famous escudella and carn dolla. We enjoyed it. Very good, with quality ingredients and sufficient quantities. A typical dish of Catalan gastronomy with some varieties according to geography and with similar equivalents in our neighboring country. Haddock is a good restaurant, away from formalities, with quality market cuisine and contained prices."

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Great. I will be back for sure
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,A masterful bowl. The Catalan dish par excellence in a sublime state. Efficiency when serving. And a price in line with the quality it offers. Highly recommended.
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Different service where the waitress advises the dishes and quantities to order. He suggested we share, which was not to everyones taste. I know it is not an obligation but it is a way to try several dishes. Not everyone eats everything. This aside, the food was very good. A place to return to."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Very innovative place with very good food and a very reasonable price. Good service.
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Exquisite tripe! Service leaves a lot to be desired, especially the blonde girl waitress (Russian/Ukrainian), arrogant tone and hurried air."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"We had a very good lunch today. Croquettes, prawn carpaccio, cuttlefish casserole with meatballs and tripe. Everything very good. Very good service. We missed the letter in Catalan (if they had it, they didnt offer it to us). Letter only. Price 45 eur pp."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,A place that offers market cuisine and gastronomic events of Catalan cuisine such as Escudella i carn d Olla that stand out in the citys offerings for their quality and for being almost unique. The place is cozy with a decoration with its own character. There are a lot of live nights.

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"I was going with certain reservations... the photos seen here did not attract me much and, although it had been recommended to me, I had my doubts. Well, it has been a great success of the place!!! Unbeatable area in the heart of Eixample, the place, with a discreet entrance, opens into a dining room full of decorative surprises loaded with personality. They dont want to be like anyone, they dont want to go with the flow. They are scoundrels as the name itself indicates. And thats how it is with food... they dont look for the pretty plate with a balance of colors, they look for (and get) respectful treatment of a top-notch product that results in spectacular dishes, full of authentic flavor. To start, they give you a plate with lettuce  yes, just lettuce. And when you try it you understand!! And the lettuce doesnt need more because its real and because it tastes really good. We ordered torrezno from Soria (Im from the area and I can attest that this torrezno was very, very well made), some sauteed mushrooms (I dont remember the name of the dish as such) which were delicious, cocochas tortilla, which at first bite I knew was the love of my life  , lamb chops with potatoes (simple dish, unpretentious, but loaded with flavor, well cooked. Very delicious) and for dessert, the cream chucho that was the final touch. I dont have a but. The treatment received by the waiter and chef was so good that you fell in love!! I look forward to returning, we left many things to try and Im sure we will be back soon."

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"This restaurant is the most traditional you can find, from its workers to its food, everything is 10/10, they have the best quality ingredients and everything is homemade!!! Highly recommended!!! If you are in Barcelona and want to see what a traditional restaurant is."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Everything is very homemade, the chef knows it, I am happy every time I am there with my husband and we eat wonderfully."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"It is not recommended to go in a group. Since there were more than ten of us, they suggested we close a menu that was expensive and insufficient. Very small portions. The food was good, I guess, because there wasnt enough for everyone. And the strangest thing is that we had two last-minute cancellations and they raised the agreed price of the menu. A very bad deal. What a pity! We wont be able to go back."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Group dinner of 12 diners, due to last minute problems there were 10 of us. They charged us for 12. The portions were not even for 8; the quality, far from the agreed price; The managements treatment was terrible (not that of the waitresses). The level of the dishes was very fair, with ingredients that were too basic for the final price (50 euros, instead of the 45 agreed upon). We were in a room on the upper floor, the only thing notable. Everything else, a scam. We will not return."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"I loved the atmosphere. The sensational food. Call to reserve a table. Good service. Recommended, if in doubt."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Traditional food... macaroni... tripe... Russian salad... very well prepared. Curious place, very personal. Lunchtime customers made up of retirees who meet up with their lifelong friends and Allergic to spherifications and other modernities. Live music some scoundrel nights. Recommended."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Nice place, friendly waitresses, very nice chef! we will repeat"
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,We have chosen a new restaurant to celebrate a complicated day. Perfect food and service. Grilled squid and high-quality macaroni. We will definitely be back with more time to try more dishes of the day.
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,The snails and salats were bad and the service very unfriendly
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"The food is of very good quality, the atmosphere accumulates a lot of noise from the other tables (there was only one table of 8 people). Both the daily dishes and the a la carte dishes are very good, but they do not have a lunch menu."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Great discovery in Barcelona. Quality food made with local produce and perfect service. You can see the affection that Fran conveys with his dishes.
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Such care for the product!!! Amazing catalan food, well cooked but with the respect to keep the nature of the fresh product"
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Phenomenal product quality, super attentive and careful service, I recommend it"

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"An impeccable dinner! We mostly ordered dishes of the day/season. Everything incredible, especially the sauce of the dishes that came in casseroles. We havent looked at the wine list. Very good service too, friendly and smart, knowing there was a party upstairs and letting us know to order before them. Very cozy place. We will be back for sure! Thank you so much!"

Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,Good food but quite high price
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"The letter is exceptional. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to recover the flavors of the past. The bread, well done, and a lettuce like no other in Barcelona, stole our hearts. The dishes were cooked extraordinarily, with a great balance of tastes, textures and historical recovery of the Catalan recipe. Generous in quantity and quality. I recommend it to people who are nostalgic for the kitchen of a lifetime and have a good palate. Simple peas make you cry because they are so good. We were very comfortable there because the tables have enough separation to talk and hear each other; the music is suitable to allow conversation in a way that accompanies and the volume does not get in the way. The place is unique and the service very attentive and correct. Perhaps I was surprised by the offer of desserts, where I would have expected to find a version of a musicians dessert, toast of Santa Teresa, bread with oil and chocolate or an annealing of fonteta rather than cakes, but we did not get to try them because even though we never eat bread, we soaked it up as much as we could! We were also surprised by the restaurants opening hours, which close, for example, on Saturday night. It corresponds to a better reconciliation between hospitality and the life of your family environment. Who knows, maybe thats why the dishes are made with so much love. In any case, its worth going out during the week, when the city is quieter, and discover places like the Haddock!"
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Quality food from bread to desserts, wine, etc."
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,
Haddock - La Taverne Canaille,"Sorry, but the above review came out early and not the way I wanted. The dinner was very good, dishes as usual with great quality and presentation. The lettuce salad you offered us, outstanding and an idea I think is brilliant. Well be coming back !"
Pure Cuisine,"Tourist trap. Be ware, don t get confused with the misleading prices - Pad Thai is without any meat, it is just vegetables and an egg and it is not even Pad Thai. They don t tell you anything about that and if you find out too late, they will just charge you and force you to take it. Given the reviews it looks like local preferences might be this kind of food, but Pad Thai here has nothing to do with Pad Thai  . I tried it and it tastes like instant Chinese soup with added soya. I usually don t throw food into trash, but this one is the worst I ve had so it ended up in a trash. Disgusting. The guy said it is obvious because of the price. So I guess I have to expect this in Barcelona Just a few meters away, there is Canton Food 2, which has similar prices to the bases here (Pad Thai was 7 ). Recommend going there instead, cheaper and nice people, much better food. Response: Yes, it is misleading, because you call something Pad Thai. Furthermore what you call Pad Thai had round and most likely from whey noodles - but the noodles should be wide and made from rice. And no, I did not enjoy, as stated before I had to throw it away as it tasted so bad."
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"I think they changed management and now they dont have a childrens combo or a menu of the day, they serve you in the most normal way, I recommend pure cuisine from the Glorias shopping center. This is bland"
Pure Cuisine,"In Barcelona trying many places, stopped here, walking by. Liked that you can build your own meal and add whatever you want. Ordered mixed vegetables with pork,chicken,steak with spicy sauce. Side of white rice. Took it back to our hotel and ate it all!! It was yummy. Not too salty, great mix of ingredients.  Enjoyed every bite! If we lived here we would be there a lot."
Pure Cuisine,Good place to eat Thai food
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,Chinese-Thai-Japanese fast-food. Good Asian food at a reasonable price. If only all Fast-food were of this quality
Pure Cuisine,Pad Thai very good. Good place to eat in this area and good price
Pure Cuisine,"I went to another place as soon as it opened at 12 oclock, and since I was the first customer, they gave me a free menu. The food is also decent"
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,Great ramens
Pure Cuisine,"Very good food, highly recommended."
Pure Cuisine,"Nice little place BUT the pad tai they make its not pad tai, they use different noodles an it tastes like fried Chinese noodles..i"
Pure Cuisine,"I dont give a zero, because it is not possible. I was served noodles with an unidentified object. A large plastic piece, like the closure of a can. They gave me my money back, yes."
Pure Cuisine,We were 8/9 people and spent about  10 per person. Everything is very good! The peanut sauce with the rice noodles was very good!
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"If youre Asian, this is a taste you wont like! The staff is friendly and the food is simple."
Pure Cuisine,Amazing
Pure Cuisine,

Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"Typical take out, the beef wok was very good."
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,I ate there today recently everything was good but there were vegetables that were dry and the broccoli not very fresh the rest everything was good very friendly waiter
Pure Cuisine,The fried rice isnt too salty and its okay. It was okay to feed the child. Full of fire scent... I added beef to the oyster sauce. Excellent cost-effectiveness
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"The staff is very friendly and quite fast in their work, the atmosphere is good as many times here and what can I say about the food 10/10"
Pure Cuisine,"Noodles where rehydrated, the cheapest of the cheap. I asked for Huera, and didnt get it. The label didnt come in Spanish/English/Catalan with the food. Tourist trap. Stay away! Vegetarian options: Huera options, if they actually listen to you and put it in.."
Pure Cuisine,Beef phad tai with 2 pieces of beef
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,Simply. 0.01/5 star. The gyoza was moldy. The staff didnt check it and it meant it was not fresh. It was so disgusting. After complaining they changed it with new one but my feeling was so angry. Unprofessional and not recommended.
Pure Cuisine,"Its not bad for the price, at least its natural and you see how they do it."
Pure Cuisine,"I ordered the exotic rice, with soy sauce (extra) and chicken and they made it without soy for  8 This in itself was not as it should be, poorly sauteed, undercooked chicken, boiled texture, nothing special  it looked like pre-cooked supermarket rice I will order the noodles again, see if that earns 1. + For now 3  overall 5/10"
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"The chicken fried rice was excellent and exactly what I was craving. Spot on and delicious, I havent stopped thinking about this meal for a week! Dietary restrictions: Gluten free"
Pure Cuisine,I have eaten here many times and I have always paid with a restaurant card. Now they dont accept the Edenred card and when I ask why? They act like they dont understand and repeat the restaurant card is not accepted. Nov 28: I came back because they said they would accept the Edenred card and in the end they still dont accept it. They lie blatantly!
Pure Cuisine,"Delicious, recommend curry beef!"
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,Horrible place! Horrible food and worse service...
Pure Cuisine,Great tasting food in the middle of barcelona
Pure Cuisine,Delicious noodles at good prices.
Pure Cuisine,Really delicious meals at very affordable prices. I enjoyed the chicken wok.
Pure Cuisine,"Fast, varied, super delicious, cheap and with well-indicated vegan and vegetarian options. Friendly waiters and dynamic Asian atmosphere. We will return for sure. Vegetarian options: Various meatless options! And well indicated."
Pure Cuisine,I had an amazing experience at Pure Cuisine. Their restaurant is very clean and offers a comfy dining experience. Their eating selections are easily customizable and give a fast and healthy dining option. Great quality and quantity for a great price.
Pure Cuisine,"Sauf petite erreur dans ma commande (nouilles udon au b uf au lieu de poulet) c etait parfait. Bonne portion, service rapide, gout excellent!"
Pure Cuisine,"Terrible food, without making either the vegetables or the noodles. A disappointment."
Pure Cuisine,Good
Pure Cuisine,Nice
Pure Cuisine,"The three delicious rice is very bad, with no taste at all."
Pure Cuisine,Freshly cooked Asian food. Good service. Price/performance ratio fits. Perfect for a quick hunger pang.
Pure Cuisine,Ordered the Thai bowl de ternera from Uber eat and what I received undercooked rare beef and undercooked rice. You could tell that this order was prepared in a hurry without any regards about the safety quality control. I will never eat here again
Pure Cuisine,Its been super good Kid-friendliness: I have children and we came here
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"They are the best. The dish is cooked instantly and quickly, achieving a very good result, with flavor and quality. I have returned many times and I will continue coming. My favorite dish is rice noodles with shrimp or chicken wok."
Pure Cuisine,"Large portions at reasonable prices. You compose the dish yourself by choosing the pasta, meat and sauce. Really tasty."
Pure Cuisine,The food is delicious and fresh. But the atmosphere of the establishment leaves much to be desired. Lots of flies and little space. I recommend taking food with you
Pure Cuisine,Evil. Vegetarian options: Poor quality tofu
Pure Cuisine,"Quick, delicious, good price!"
Pure Cuisine,"Here you build your plate and you will almost always get something healthy and delicious. The alternatives go very well with each other and the prices are quite good, especially if you compare them with those of nearby restaurants. The only expensive thing is the drink, which is understandable. Try beef and shrimp as protein, you wont regret it."
Pure Cuisine,"I ordered for a thai pad with chicken, the food was tasty and the size was big. I ate there and the place was quiet"
Pure Cuisine,Delicious... exquisite... and warm
Pure Cuisine,"Delicious food at an affordable price  6 for some noodles or rice, Pretty good service and the place is beautiful. Recommendable!!"
Pure Cuisine,"The place is poorly air-conditioned, with the doors open in the sweltering heat at noon. Not very clean. Too expensive!"
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"The food was very delicious but I dont give it more stars because when I was halfway through the meal small cockroaches started to appear, and although nothing appeared in the food I cant trust that the kitchen is really pest-free"
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,Very good
Pure Cuisine,"Everything was very good until yesterday, we ordered the same food as always but we added pineapple and this was terrible, it was soggy, very hard and with a bad taste. We will never return, at least to this one located in Plaza Cataluna."
Pure Cuisine,Kid-friendliness: Si Food
Pure Cuisine,"It has been a pleasure to once again enjoy the service that I knew at CC La Maquinista, without a doubt a shame that they are not better known, they offer excellent service."
Pure Cuisine,Love the food!
Pure Cuisine,"Everything good, even the price"
Pure Cuisine,Loveeeee ittttt!!! Keep up the good work
Pure Cuisine,I really liked it!
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"For me, a really good place for a quick luch, if you like Asian cuisine. I ordered Pad Thai with tofu, for which I waited 10 minutes tops. The food was delicious - tofu was tasty, the noodles were good as well (I think they used mie noodles which I love), the veggies tasted nice and fresh and everything was coated in a flavoury sauce. I recommend it to everyone who likes Pad Thai   And the price is reasonable as well, as I paid 8,90 for the meal. Vegetarian options: Pad Thai with tofu - very tasty."
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,"Very delicious food, fast service, good price quality, if you dont know where to eat and you are in the area this place is highly recommended."
Pure Cuisine,Tasty food. They should use less oil in their cooking especially since they call it Healthy.
Pure Cuisine,Its good because its a lot and its made right away.
Pure Cuisine,"It is simply VERY RICH, fresh and abundant. You buy 1 wok but eat twice. The ingredients look good and have flavor. I come back every time Im in the area!"
Pure Cuisine,"I have ordered twice through Uber Eats and both times I came missing a product from the order. The food is good, but the service is terrible!!! I do not recommend it for delivery."
Pure Cuisine,
Pure Cuisine,They have few options to choose from and few varieties of side dishes too. Food was tasty and good portion for the price
Pure Cuisine,"The food is no longer what it was... they started at the machinist and it was delicious, they moved here and now the quality has plummeted. The beef was practically uncooked, the egg was sandy, the noodles were soggy... Im sorry to say that we will never return again."
Pure Cuisine,"A new fast catering concept, with fresh ingredients and healthy recipes. A variety of Thai, Japanese and Chinese cuisine options, delicious and at affordable prices. Their motto, Asian Healthy Food, with authentic flavors! They have an extensive menu with Thai, Japanese and Chinese cuisine options, delicious and at very affordable prices. They have Combos, Thai Box, Thai Bowl, Meat Box, Specialties, Dim Sum, Salads, Drinks and much more They have show cooking available for main dishes. The box   portions are huge, great for sharing -  Gyozas stuffed with pork  3.90 -  Shaomai with pork and vegetables  4.20 -   Takoyaki (octopus balls with teriyaki sauce)  5.50 -  Pad Thai sauteed with egg, cabbage, carrot and onion  8.90 + chicken, beef and prawns  5.70 You can see the entire review on marywave_foodies Instagram"

El Quinto,
El Quinto,"Like at home ! Beautiful place full of art, very delicious beers....I recommend Floppy  .... Spectacular treatment....I always come back....thanks the fifth for this experience"
El Quinto,"A great option to eat in the area! The kitchen is completely gluten free and the bread with gluten is handled separately, making it completely safe for celiacs and certified. The food was very good, very tasty and homemade, and the people who run it were very friendly. I will be back!"
El Quinto,"Great service, fast and friendly. The food was mostly very good, just the meat dish I ordered was a bit on the bland side, but otherwise, great!"
El Quinto,
El Quinto,"My personal experience has been BAD. The image of the place betrayed me....The terrace seemed nice and I wanted to have breakfast. There were no customers either on the terrace or inside. I went in and ordered in Catalan: Un cafe amb llet i un entrepa petit de pernil amb pa i tomaquet, a typical type of sandwich in Catalonia (normally the waitress asks if country or serrano ham?). The girls look was as if I were an alien... I immediately repeated it in Spanish. Her facial expression did not improve and while she was taking note of the order she confirmed it by saying ham and cheese sandwich..., I corrected no, no, a small ham sandwich with bread with tomato... it already seemed like that I had understood... After a while, already on the terrace, he brings me the coffee with milk with two pieces of bread with Sweet ham.... Here, I already told him with a somewhat angrier tone that I didnt want that dish .. I insisted that I had ordered a ham sandwich with bread and tomato, and I had already repeated it 3 times... After a while another waiter comes and brings me the same two pieces of bread with two small slices of the worst salty ham I have ever tasted. It may be that the mistake is mine... NEVER ORDER A HAM SANDWICH WITH BREAD AND TOMATO IN -EL QUINTO-. THEY DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS. By the way, this culinary experience cost me more than  6. Never more....."
El Quinto,
El Quinto,
El Quinto,"We went with 2 work colleagues. We ordered the food at 1:10 p.m. and at 2:04 p.m. we still havent received anything. When we asked what was happening, they told us that  they have a lot of people and only one cook, and they dont know when he will leave. I understand the situation, but it is an office area, they cannot take 1 hour to bring dishes, without even offering at least an apology or a bit of attention while waiting."
El Quinto,"Very delicious and simple food, like cooked at home. Very fast and super friendly service. The menu is complete and you are satisfied. Highly recommended. I will be back"

El Quinto,"Everything was very good, the place was charming and they treated us very well. You can not ask for more"
El Quinto,Its all very rich. Although the food is a bit scarce for the price. It also has gluten-free options so its great.
El Quinto,"I havent eaten there, but its not for tea. I ordered a chai tea with oat milk. It was not very hot and you could barely notice the infusion. The price is 3.20. If it is with water 2.20. But oat milk isnt worth that much. Im looking for a place around here since I have the company nearby, so I can have tea without being disturbed during my break."
El Quinto,
El Quinto,
El Quinto,Super healthy and with a lot of flavor. During my stay in Barcelona I visited the place 3 times. Highly recommended!

El Quinto,Delicious place for a healthy lunch and they also donate menu of the day!
El Quinto,"The small restaurant is very centrally located near several co-working spaces and invites you to have lunch. There is a nice, varied lunch cart that changes every day and vegans can also find something to eat here. The food is super tasty and freshly prepared. The prices for the starter, main course and dessert are between  15 and  20, which is absolutely fine."
El Quinto,"Excellent service and the menu is great. Every day there is a new dish. The organic products are noticeable in the flavor and in my case they are gluten-free and lactose-free. It is my favorite place to have lunch in Pobleno. Super recommend. Super affordable prices. Dietary restrictions: Gluten-free, lactose-free, foods grown without chemicals, some vegetarian dishes."
El Quinto,The food is incredible and so is the attention! I recommend 100% to know the Fifth

El Quinto,
El Quinto,"I loved this place: the food is tasty and healthy, it has a nice terrace and the atmosphere in general is pleasant. The waiters, a boy and a girl, have been super friendly.

El Quinto,"Good dishes, great flavors"
El Quinto,Excellent restaurant avec un menu bio et frais. La soupe de tomate etait succulente et le plat principal egalement. Terrasse agreable et service rapide. Impeccable pour le midi !
El Quinto,
El Quinto,The best restaurant in Barcelona! The service is very friendly and supportive. The location is close to the metro and you can sit outside or inside. It is also a perfect location to go for lunch with business colleagues. But the best is- the dishes and food is 100% ecological and bio. And the taste is brilliant. During our time in Barcelona we checked out a lot of restaurants but this is definitely the best. The prices are also affordable. So do something good to yourself and visit the restaurant. We went there three times and had the chance to experience the different dishes. All were 5 stars.
El Quinto,Nice atmosphere!
El Quinto,Dietary restrictions: Sin gluten Food
El Quinto,"Wow! Absolutely amazing, simply everything!! Very delicious food and 100 percent biological / ecological / organic ingredients!!!

El Quinto,"This place was the best food I ve had in Barcelona! I m a vegetarian and some places have limited options, but this place has everything at an affordable cost. Owner is extremely nice and talked to us throughout our meal. If you are in the area, check them out!"
El Quinto,I dont put less because its not possible for me its a 0 score. Thai-style quinoa dish with chicken  12.40 and not a generous portion at all. It seems abusive to me and not at all tasty.
El Quinto,"Poor food, the coconut chicken with curry and quinoa tastes neither like coconut nor curry. Disappointing."

El Quinto,"Clarify that I only went to have coffee without many expectations (you know, Spain and coffee, its not usually a good marriage) - I ended up having two espressos (plus an apple crumble) and I would have had at least one more.

El Quinto,"For me, the best restaurant to eat at noon in Poble Nou. They always offer quality and local organic products in dishes that are always very original and tasty, also offering vegan options. They are also very nice and always attentive so that you are very comfortable."
El Quinto,
El Quinto,"First the (not so) bad... pricier than other places in the immediate area but not as expensive as places downtown. About 18  for two plates (entre and main dish), water and bread. Now the good... some of the BEST food Ive tasted in Barcelona. Great vibes, good music. Great, friendly staff. Feels very clean. I would 100% eat here again and recommend. 5 stars"
El Quinto,Delicious and healthy food prepared today. I tried several dishes and all were very tasty and original. There are vegetarian and vegan options. Excellent atmosphere and service.
El Quinto,The food is organic and very delicious. The waiters treated us great
El Quinto,"I went during lunch time and the place seemed nice. The menu is more expensive in comparison to other organic places in the area. Main courses are like 10,11 euros alones while other places nearby offer a full menu for 12 euros that includes entry, main course and dessert. They said while explaining the menu, that their high prices are because everything is organic, but most of the neighborhood s places have organic food and charge half. By 1 pm some dishes had run out of the menu. They offered me a special off menu course because there were no vegetarian options left, they said it was a quinoa bowl with tofu. We got our entry course and then had to ask the main course to go because after 45 minutes of being sat there, they hadn t brought the food and we had to go back to the office. When we called out the owner about the lack of speed they didn t seem to care. When i opened my plate, they had given me raw rice, not quinoa. The rice was not edible."
El Quinto,Very good coffee. Very tasty breakfast. Very friendly staff and nice atmosphere
El Quinto,"The other day I was walking through Poble Nou, where after spending a while I got hungry. I just came across this place and decided to go in. A very kind guy understood me, and advised me what to order. The truth is that everything is very good, adding to the service, great. I would come again"
El Quinto,"The other day I went to eat and they treated me very well, a blonde waiter took great care of us, the food is excellent. We will repeat!"
Bistro Sagrada,Service top class and food absolutely fantastic. High recommendation.

Bistro Sagrada,We were welcomed by a good mood team for our last dinner in Barcelona. I enjoyed the food good patatas bravas but I was a bit disappointed by the fideua and the paella. In term of quality of the ingredient and the taste It was acceptable. We tasted much better and a more generous plate for the same price the day before.
Bistro Sagrada,Surprisingly good food. Lots to choose from. Ok prices considering that it is close to Sagrada
Bistro Sagrada,"Prices are high and while the Tapas were good there are better Tapas to be found, at better prices, outside of the sagrada area. The man who was working was not particularly welcoming but the server who arrived a little later was friendly."

Bistro Sagrada,"Nice place, kind and helpful staff. Prices are not high) 5/5"
Bistro Sagrada,The paella was worth the price and the dumplings were surprisingly moist and delicious. The hamburger meat was dry and disappointing. It seems like a decent brasserie. 71 euros for three (including drinks)
Bistro Sagrada,"Great food, great service, great price!  Fully recommended!"
Bistro Sagrada,very friendly Tastes good too
Bistro Sagrada,Delicious
Bistro Sagrada,"Premier point c est cher. La serveuse aimable mais elle a insiste fortement pour qu on commande un plat supplementaire, du coup c etait trop au final. Les seches fries etaient tres bonnes mais les moules etaient vraiment trop salees et la paella n etait pas exceptionnelle pour 18,5 Tres decu."

Bistro Sagrada,Good food with friendly staff i recommend here
Bistro Sagrada,"Tourist trap with disastrous quality, 5-star reviews are obviously paid/bots. So far the worst place we ve been in Barcelona Food"
Bistro Sagrada,"We ate there on our first day, and the second day we went somewhere else, it looked much nicer but the food and the service were nowhere near. So the third time we ate here again and one member of the staff recognised us and offered free drink (limonchelo)after the lunch. Good food, good portions,very friendly staff. Kid-friendliness: Kid portions are available."
Bistro Sagrada,"It s a great place, food was really nice. The staff is very nice. I would highly recommend to anyone."

Bistro Sagrada,"Had an amazing experience at Bistro Sagrada. The food was absolutely delicious, and every dish was a flavor explosion. The service was impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff making the dining experience memorable. What truly set this place apart for me was the fantastic choice of rock music playing in the background. Highly recommend for foodies who appreciate great taste, excellent service, and a rocking ambiance!"

Bistro Sagrada,The tastiest vegetarian paella ever eaten. Very friendly owner and good location. Definitely recommended to eat here.
Bistro Sagrada,Best quality of food for reasonable price a the service was great #paella #Tapas # recommend!!
Bistro Sagrada,"The worst tapas restaurant I have ever been. We were four and went for a New Year s Eve dinner. The rissoto is regular rice with some mushrooms and really expensive, they suggested us to ask for two portions that were too much and as it was tasteless we didn t liked. It is not real Spanish cuisine: the paella was not well cooked and everything is bad quality, seems like frozen food and microwaved, really the worst experience I have had in Barcelona. The worst place I have ever been, I advise to get out of that tourist trap as soon as possible and don t eat there. It was really expensive and you can get better in a different area."
Bistro Sagrada,Great quality food for reasonable price and the service was great as well!! Would definitely recommend!!
Bistro Sagrada,
Bistro Sagrada,
Bistro Sagrada,"I ordered salad, paella (basic), and gambas aglio. The paella was really delicious! It felt like a strange taste of eating stir-fried rice after eating rice cake, so it hit my mouth. The clerks are also friendly! The salad looked ordinary, but the olives in it were really delicious. It was a shame that the Gambas got a little cold."

Bistro Sagrada,Food was nice but expensive
Bistro Sagrada,I tried tapas and paella at Bistro Sagrada. Tapas at Bistro Sagrada are a deliciously elegant experience. The food presentation and flavors are rich and inventive. The best paella in the city and the best nachos near Sagrada Familia
Bistro Sagrada,"We got surprise near Sagrada familia very good foods and best service ## typical spanish foods, tapas and Sangria ## Recomended  dish Eggplants with romesco sauce and black rice paella is the best."
Bistro Sagrada,"The meal was very good, but the prices are quite high (like everywhere in Barcelona). The waitress was kind and helpful. We ordered grilled vegetables and desk of cheese and sausage - very tasteful"

Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Very welcoming and pleasant service and environment. I tried the  El vegetal  wrap, simple but really tasty. I recommend it if you want to make a quick stop to eat in the Sagrada Familia area Vegetarian options: Perfect for vegans and vegetarians, there are many options"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,Super nice place! The lunch menu of salad + smoothie is very delicious and fresh.
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,It has been good   the girls have been friendly.
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"We arrive and they offer food without a separate kitchen. They do it all in the same bar, leaving a very unpleasant smell of smoke, since they do not have good ventilation. We ordered the crispy chicken for almost 8 euros because they looked good in the photo. They opened the frozen bag in front of us. They tasted just like the ones at Mercadona, just like the sauce. The kitchen is not clean. They do everything on the same plates that looked dirty. Tasteless food and it has caused us some stomach discomfort. When paying we were charged almost 8 euros more by mistake. Everyone can make mistakes and nothing happens, but when we complain they look at us with disgust and have a hard time making a refund. I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone."
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"I feel scammed, I thought it was expensive for the quality of the product and its all frozen or jarred"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,Love this place. Such fresh food and great salad combinations. The Caesars choice is my favorite. Definitely come if you feel like a fresh bite in the area!
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"I have gone several times. Normally first thing in the morning since there is only one person for the kitchen, bar, tables and cashier. It has a bit of saturation on some key days. Since next to Avenida Gaudi it has a lot of tourists. The food is very good and they are very friendly. For the attention of the manager. Put one more person on key days so that your business has comfortable customer service"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"We had the oriental salad, pulled pork wrap and a greek salad. The oriental salad was absolutely below our standards and expectations. Dry rice, little flavour, strange tasting salmon, and gave us stomach aches. The hygiene was poor, the outdoor tables weren t clean and even the bowls weren t properly washed. The waiters were super nice and friendly and I really feel bad that I have to say this, but in all honesty I can t recommend this place to anyone. It was too expensive for the poor quality. (The smoothies were very good though)"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Terrible bikinis. Bland...with purchased hard-boiled egg. I understood that they would give us natural eggs, there was nothing creamy inside the bikini. Hot on the outside and cold on the inside. Mushrooms dont taste like anything. The fruit juice was watered down and very bad...well, I wont say anything else...because I dont want to ruin the business, but get going! If you go with a person in a wheelchair, dont tell me to go in and ask... with an insurmountable step to enter. Go out and be helpful... look at the people who are not robots....."

Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,Amazing smoothie and quite good wrap. Friendly stuff and nice location. Will come back
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,Great wraps
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Good food, slightly high prices, I suppose due to the location. Two bikinis with coffee and a chai  15. The bikinis were good, maybe a little tasteless... they lacked flavor... otherwise, a pleasant terrace, and very friendly staff."
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Some fantastic and very natural products. The establishment is very pleasant, as is the terrace. The workers are very friendly and fast. I totally recommend it."

Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Very nice, right in front of the hospital, with incredible views, super good service, I recommend the brownie and carrot cake"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Very friendly and fast service, prices a little high for what they offer but they specialize in using natural and good quality ingredients. The food was good although it lacked a little salt, which was easily resolved. Inside the premises the space is limited and hot, and outside it is noisy, since it is a street very busy with cars and people, it is normal. My salmon wrap was good, I just wish it was bigger or with more ingredients."
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,super good and not too busy!! staff is super nice. we didnt have anything to eat but I had a chai matcha latte and that was the best thing Ive ever had

Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"I walked in by chance and found lovely staff and an incredible salad!! And to top it off, a delicious homemade dessert! Ill be back for sure! Dietary restrictions: Celiac, food intolerances"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"I ordered two chai lattes and it was horrible, they dont have a guy there who doesnt know how to make it, we spent  7 on two undrinkable chais. It was full of lumps without being beaten well. The thing is that I saw the boy mix the powder in the same cardboard cup as the coffee and thats not how its done!!!! They have people there making drinks without prior learning or how is it??? The sachet containing the chai is placed directly in the metal jug where the milk is heated!!! There, with the heat, everything mixes and there are no lumps. Awful. Very unprofessional. I paid for two drinks that I couldnt have and on top of that one of the glasses was broken and I stained everything. We will not return."
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,Super friendly staff! I loved the smoothies and especially the possibility of being able to make a salad to your liking. The acai bowl is highly recommended!! We will be back soon!
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,They claim to be green but they had nothing vegan on the menu. 100% greenwashing.
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Excellent lives up to its name, health based food well balanced, the type you can give to people around you or recommend to others without guilt. I had a chicken and salmon wrap. The salmon wrap was surprisingly devoid of the large amount of salt that I usually put up with so it was fantastic and took away my last reservations in regards to the dish. The sweet mustard sauce was put on the side so that the wraps are not sweet and you can choose how much sugar you want to expose yourself to. All in all fantastic, health conscious, recommend anyone with chronic illness or family with metabolic disorder come here and eat."
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"I loved it. Very pleasant treatment. Very tasty menu. Variety, quality, reasonable price"
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,Very good quality food and incredible flavor!
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"I ordered an Acai bowl to take away and the truth is that it was delicious. In addition, the guys were very friendly and took care of me and served me right away."

Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"Terrible quality of the food, I ordered the Nordic salad and the rice was raw and seemed like it was made days ago. The lettuce was clearly from a supermarket bag as was the feta cheese. They use the same sauce for absolutely everything. The sweet potatoes, the salads, the wraps... A disappointment for what its worth. The only good thing was the attention of the waiters, very friendly."
Green Kiss - Hospital Sant Pau,"smoothies take a while to make but the apple pie smoothie was amazing, worth the wait"

Delicious pao de queijo pop corn (the best I have ever eaten, even counting those from Brazil) as well as the tapioca dadinhos, the escondidinho and the moqueca. Absolutely everything brutal. The place is well decorated, run with care and the service is very good. I have been several times and since I leave I plan to return."

Refresc House,"I liked it a lot since I was in Brazil and I had never eaten a moqueca as delicious as Refresc, there was a man next to me who ate the same dish with his eyes closed, it is an experience that everyone should share, and the brigadero always orders dessert with pacoca."
Refresc House,"What can we say about this treasure in Barcelona! So many times one reads or hears that food is love, thats how we feel it in this place. They treated us very warmly and the dishes are incredible. Everything we tried was super delicious, full of color and new flavors. Thank you for what you do and what you deliver."

I return for the second time thinking that it must have been a bad day for her but she left me waiting 15 minutes for a menu when the place was attended and not full. I wanted to order takeout and I didnt even do it because he decided to serve someone else who came in immediately instead of me who had been waiting for 15 minutes. The food is good but the service makes you want to come back. I let him know and he acted like it was nothing...

Refresc House,"Second time here and they keep improving! The dishes are authentic Brazilian food, with very reasonable prices. Chef Carol was there to greet us and managed to accommodate our big group (the restaurant was quite busy) and was always checking the customers, overseen the kitchen/bar. Brazilian touch in the decoration, good Brazilian music playing. Will definitely come back and recommend this place for an authentic Brazilian experience!"
Refresc House,"Went with some brazilian friends. Absolutely amazing, 10/10. Staff is really nice smilly and gentle, the place is really chill like you feel at home, and last but not least  the food is so good. I recommend try Pao de Queijo, they re so delicious. If you want a chill place with friendly atmosphere close to barceloneta, that s your place."
Refresc House,"The best Brazilian restaurant in the city, it is always good to go there and feel closer to the food and Brazil, the cheese bread with pulled pork is delicious"

Ne pensez pas que laspect instagramable des plats est le seul atout de ce restaurant, les plats sont incroyables notamment les beignets aux tapiocas qui saccompagne dune sauce aigre douce fabuleuse . Je recommande meme si vous netes que de passage."
Refresc House,"Quality Brazilian food, at a fair price!"
Refresc House,Delicious food and such lovely staff! They managed to make traditional Brazilian flavors in a healthy way. Highly recommend.
Refresc House,"Everything was exquisite, the best bread with Milanese I ever tried and the dish of the day was incredible. Also, excellent service and delicious desserts."
BANG BANG,"Ridiculous portions for the price you pay, the food was cold in some parts, you can tell that it is reheated. Not recommended."
BANG BANG,"Small portions of food for the price you pay, 2 naked burritos + tequenos + 1 bottle of water around 30 euros. Naked burritos were small, comparation of my headphones case with the ball size Food"
BANG BANG,"I ordered the BANG BANG experience and I loved it, it is a super complete sharing menu and the food was 10/10 I will 100% eat here again!"
BANG BANG,Best burritos in Barcelona! Tasty and good price. Staff very kind and attentive
BANG BANG,"Among a wide variety of options in the shopping center, we chose to eat at this restaurant. We opted for the daily lunch menu option, which was  12 for a burrito (or burrito in bowl format), two tequenos (cheese or Nutella) and a drink (from a can). We found the price more than acceptable. The attention and service was good. We ordered at the counter and they brought it to our table. It should be noted that they did not have the vegetarian burrito available, since they had run out of product, so we took a beef burrito and another chicken burrito. Both burritos were quite disappointing. The rice was hard, it lacked cooking. Overall, the burrito lacked flavor. It had a lot of oil and little sauce, which made it very difficult to eat. Also the pieces of meat were very large. The tequenos were good, but it wasnt worth it at all. The main course is the most important thing in a meal, and if that fails, the rest matters little. Vegetarian options: They have a burrito with vegetable meat Parking: There is parking in the shopping center itself Kid-friendliness: Kid friendly Wheelchair accessibility: There are elevators and the entrance to the restaurant has no steps"
BANG BANG,"We ordered two burritos, a really bad experience, many ingredients with little flavor, hard rice, tasteless Tex-Mex chicken, dry meats, little sauce and the ingredients were not mixed inside the taco, a lot to improve"
BANG BANG,"I don t know how they are surviving. Very basic, not so tasty and overpriced."
BANG BANG,"Not very good food and pricey for what you get. Rice was not cooked fully, not much flavor overall."
BANG BANG,"The most delicious burritos in Barcelona!!!! I recommend them 100%, Manus attention is wonderful! We will be back!"
BANG BANG,"Friendly and efficient treatment from the girl at the bar Delicious food, to vary a little flavor in that area of the shopping center"
BANG BANG,"An ideal dinner to share a casual moment with someone you love. I have come several times and every time I can, I decide to return."
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"Very good service and spectacular food, highly recommended this place."
BANG BANG,"Unqualified staff, leaves a lot to be desired. Disastrous hygiene, the girl takes the products she serves you with her hand without taking hygienic measures. The lousy product and of low quality and quantity. They served it to us burnt."
BANG BANG,"Looking for a restaurant for a quick dinner in the Glories Shopping Center and taking into account the rating that this restaurant had on Google, we decided on this restaurant. We ordered a burrito, some tacos (3) and we wanted some nachos with cheese and guacamole. At 8:30 pm on a Friday night they were out of guacamole. We canceled the nachos. We ordered tequenos - which was the best of everything we ordered, but they didnt convince me either. When the tacos arrived, I realized I had made the wrong choice. 3 tacos with chicken, onion and tomato that literally broke just from touching them. Very poor quality omelet. The burrito had many ingredients but little flavor. In short, I would not repeat. Very bad quality."
BANG BANG,Been there a few times and today I gave them a last chance. Tiny burritos with no fill. On top of that I asked for extra guacamole and they just put it in a minuscule tub. Very underwhelming
BANG BANG,"A disaster, very rude waitresses, very bad customer treatment, terrible service"
BANG BANG,"The rude and rude waitress practically kicked us out before we finished eating at 10:00 oclock but speaking very badly, we will never return there"
BANG BANG,"The chicken burrito I ordered had absolutely NOO taste, just plain beans, rice, corn and the tiniest amount of chicken. No seasoning."
BANG BANG,Vegetarian options: Burrito vegano abundante y sabroso Food
BANG BANG,"Good food, nice place and great service."
BANG BANG,"100% recommended. I was attended to by Manuel, who is not only an excellent host but also someone passionate about cooking, like me! For all gourmet lovers, Bang Bang is a must-see if you are visiting Barcelona. The place is also super nice! I will definitely repeat the experience. Thank you guys and Manuel for such a pleasant moment with my family!"
BANG BANG,"Wow, what a beef burrito we ate today! INCREDIBLE and then some spectacular nachos with guacamole... Very good place to go with the family, Manu served us, he was super kind, friendly and polite. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?"
BANG BANG,Good burrito but I expected it to be tastier. The nachos are not worth it.
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"Super delicious food, good service! We will be back"
BANG BANG,"Pleasantly surprised by this place in the c.c. glories, I went with my kids and my wife, we wanted burritos and when we arrived we were served by Manu, a boy who laughs a lot and his laughter is contagious.... he advised us well since having 2 kids he recommended quesadillas for them and the truth is they have enjoyed them. The food was generally very good and the service was truly excellent."
BANG BANG,Very delicious
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"A disaster. We ordered two burritos, Chikante and Veggilicious. They put a lot of rice (we removed half, as seen in the photo...), little sauce and less chicken, which makes the food, in addition to being bad and tasteless, very expensive for what it is."
BANG BANG,Excellent service !! Highly recommended!
BANG BANG,"The food is tasteless, very poorly prepared. And expensive for what it is. The really bad thing is that on a Saturday at 2:30 p.m. there are only 2 employees with the league out. For that, the system should be Sturbucks-type so that people pick up their order once placed. But let the same person who charges bring the tray to the table and also pick it up, let the owner explain to me how that is done. They should be less stingy and think more about the client (and the employees) and put 1 or 2 more people, at least during rush hour."
BANG BANG,Good food with plenty of filling
BANG BANG,"amazing customer service, food was fulfilling and price felt like i should be paying more, will definitely come again"
BANG BANG,"Today, Sunday, 12/17, I placed an order at 3:02 p.m. (attached photo), around 3:40 p.m. I see that they serve people who have come after I approached at 3:44 p.m. and commented that we have been waiting for a long time, the girl (dark-haired) answers me that there are 3 tables in front of us, I say its not true, I take out the ticket with the time, look and she stays silent, she says they have ordered a starter, I say sorry but another lie, Im not blind, shes eating a burrito... she doesnt apologize and since nothing has happened He says now we will prepare your I do not accept and ask for a refund Its horrible, I understand that there could have been a mistake but instead of explaining and apologizing he behaved very unprofessionally."
BANG BANG,"A place I come to whenever I can, I love everything from the atmosphere to the service and the food. Everything is magnificent!!!"
BANG BANG,"Excellent food, they advised me very well on the menu, Anthony and Lini very attentive and friendly, excellent, I will return and recommend."
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"Great chocolate and Nutella tequeno. Also cheese. With burritos that are too good. I LOVE TEQUENOS, I HAVE BEEN INSISTING ON EATING TEQUENOS TO MY POOR PARENTS WHO HAVE TO SUPPORT ME. But they are so good that they ordered a double batch, I am addicted to tequenos. I LOVE THE TEQUENOS AND THE CHEESE THEY PUT ON THE BURRITOS IT IS EXTREMELY GOOD, if I could I would eat here every day but my mom wont let me, how sad. Besides, I live in Madrid. Dont be like my mom, be happy and buy tequenos."
BANG BANG,"The attention was wonderful Manu and his team always make you feel at home, the food is spectacular, the attention and customer service is exceptional, it is always pleasant to return to a place where they serve you in the best way"
BANG BANG,Very satisfied!!
BANG BANG,The best Mexican food in Barcelona. All homemade and delicious. The staff is also charming. we return
BANG BANG,"I ate here on Saturday evening as part of my trip to Barcelona and would recommend a visit to others as I enjoyed my burrito (El Chickante). The employee was also friendly and quick. Unfortunately, I have to deduct one star because the prices for medium-sized burritos here are slightly over 10 euros and that in a shopping center that almost only locals go to. Wheelchair accessibility: definitely, is located on the ground floor in the food court of the Westfield shopping center, which also has wheelchair-accessible toilets"
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"Today I had the pleasure of visiting Bang Bang and my experience was totally delicious. From the moment you walked in you were greeted by friendly staff, a cozy atmosphere and good food. Without a doubt I will return."
BANG BANG,"Super service and delicious food! Thank you to the team lead today, he made our experience awesome!"
BANG BANG,Excellent place to enjoy some tasty burritos! Very good service from the manager and even the spicy chipotle was world-class. They have a vegetarian burrito
BANG BANG,"Burrito without flavor, I have hardly seen meat or sour sauce or anything, only rice and beans, for the price it is worth absolutely nothing, I will not return"
BANG BANG,"Special mention to Manu, who took great care of us. Super friendly!!"
BANG BANG,Big and tasty burrito   What a shame they dont sell nachos at Glovo
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"Bad food. The burrito, the worst I have ever eaten. The service ignoring the minimum hygiene conditions. The girl who served us after collecting the trash went straight to preparing food without washing her hands. We asked him for a knife to cut the burritos and he brought it dirty with food stuck to it. We dont plan to return."
BANG BANG,"We ordered two bowls of burritos, the portion is tiny for the price and it is full of oil, practically everything tastes like olive oil and the guacamole with hard avocado, I do not recommend this place at all."
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,Amazing food and margharitas! Manu was fantastic. Muchas gracias!
BANG BANG,Amazing quality food. Authentic. And get that frozen Margarita! Manu

BANG BANG,The food is phenomenal! (I recommend the bang bang chips) The people are attentive and helpful! Everything has been very good  .
BANG BANG,"The mid-day menu is very delicious and economical. Includes two tequenos, a burrito and a drink."
BANG BANG,"First time but I didnt like it, I gave it a three because the girls who served were alone with quite a few people  I dont recommend it"
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"I feel cheated. 12 euros for a small and tasteless burrito, 8 euros for 5 tequenos of thick dough, 2.65 for ONE BEER and 2.10 FOR ONE WATER. Very expensive and the quality is not what is expected"
BANG BANG,"Very nice and they attended to us very quickly. The boys name is Manu, he is very kind"
BANG BANG,"Super good food and the friendliest straff, Sooo good!"
BANG BANG,The best burritos and the best service from Manu
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,Disastrous food...nothing like a few months ago...leaves a lot to be desired...I wont be back again

Liny attended to us and the truth is that she was very kind to us and treated us very well. Also, the food is super good, adequate value for money. It is a very good option if you want to eat delicious food without spending a lot."
BANG BANG,The best service and very good food!

BANG BANG,Bang Bang Chips rich rich.
BANG BANG,A 10 out of 10!!!!!
BANG BANG,
BANG BANG,"Great burritos, super nice staff. They treated our daughter very well!"
BANG BANG,"I ordered the gringo burrito naked and the taste was good, although too many different sauces for one burrito imo, but I was very disappointed in the chips with queso, I mean seems like regular packaged chips and some queso on top they were  6, I feel it s a bit much for the price! Burritos are okay but never ever order the chips with queso!!!"
BANG BANG,Cooked the el porkstar burrito and it was superb!! Am here in Barcelona on holiday and think its fun to try new dishes and this is first class food! Is from Sweden at the time of writing
KILTRO Restobar - Sant Antoni,
KILTRO Restobar - Sant Antoni,"The service was extremely friendly and accommodating! And we especially enjoyed the homemade salsa that we got with our dishes. One was milder, one was much spicier, but the friendly waiters pointed out to us several times which was which and how we could best try it. We tried nachos, quesadillas and tacos and we were impressed by everything. We also enjoyed the cocktails."

KILTRO Restobar - Sant Antoni,"They welcomed us warmly and took our orders kindly. It had a South American feel and was clean and tidy. The ceviche was so delicious.

KILTRO Restobar - Sant Antoni,A great place where you can have both cocktails and good food with a super pleasant atmosphere and waiters who will make you feel as if they have known you all your life.

Blanc,"I had a high expectation. The mocktail and dessert could be better. The chicken was very good, crunchy. The fish was oke. It s fine to sitting there, escape from the crowded street outside."
Blanc,"With a decor that would suggest fine dining, the atmosphere was more friendly and relaxed, not pretentous at all. We had a 2-course seasonal menu. While the main course (I had the veal) left me hoping for something better, the dessert certainly didn t! The deconstructed citrus pie was both genius and delicious! My fiance and I both agreed it was the best dessert we have had in a very long time, if ever. Hats off to the pastry chef! And we got a little surprise from the ever-so-friendly waiter in the end, so we left feeling happy!"
Blanc,EX PEC TA CU LAR
Blanc,
Blanc,Excellent Sunday brunch with quality food and attentive service. High-end experience indeed.
Blanc,"La comida esta muy buena y el trato del personal es exquisito. A pesar de que la carta no es muy extensa tienen opciones veganas, vegetarianas y gluten free. La presentacion de los platos y la calidad de los productos es inmejorable pero las cantidades son justas, por lo que es ideal para comer de forma equilibrada y no sentirte demasiado lleno."
Blanc,
Blanc,The food is great but the service is not good at all and extremely slow.
Blanc,J adore j adore tres elegant un moment inoubliable suis venue plusieurs fois je ne comprends pas pourquoi vous bloquez mon avis alors qu ils est tres positif car ca reflete vraiment le lieux que j adore chaque fois lorsque on vient a Barcelone on passe chez vous D ailleurs votre personnels Italiens est tres agreable A tres bientot

Blanc,"Nous y etions pour un anniversaire, un groupe de 14 personnes. The service is impeccable. The refined and super beautiful decor. The kitchen good. Splendid experience overall"
Blanc,"The experience was impeccable, well served, everything in its proper measure, the menu varied and rich. And the attention and unbeatable atmosphere. Highly recommended!"
Blanc,A cool place for lunch and meetings! The atmosphere is great!!!
Blanc,
Blanc,"We were there for a package that we took together with the hotel Spa, the truth is that the restaurant is spectacular, very beautiful and with lots of natural light. The attention of the staff was very good, consistent with the hotel and the food was very very good, perhaps the service was a little slow but as we came relaxed from the spa we were not worried. Highly recommended."
Blanc,"Just perfect. I loved each of the dishes served, flavors, aromas, all visually beautiful and delicate. From 10!"
Blanc,
Blanc,
Blanc,great people
Blanc,"Badly expensive and on top of that with blankets because of the air conditioning, just as you can eat...osmosis water and  10 for a glass of wine...the cost of a bottle purchased in the store is  9, which is a shame. .. Parking: Horrible because of the location"
Blanc,"A spectacular place, impeccable service and an excellent quality menu at an unbeatable price in Barcelona, a great discovery!! A thousand thanks to the room team and in particular to Alberto for his professionalism, kindness and always very attentive to everything. Thanks Alberto! We will return 100% for sure!!"
Blanc,"Terrible coffee, good service"
Blanc,"It has been a spectacular experience. Sara attended to us and we couldnt have been happier. Kind, attentive and always willing to help. The food is of excellent quality and the prices are very good. The design of the restaurant leaves you speechless. I recommend it to anyone, without hesitation."
Blanc,
Blanc,"Wonderful family dinner. Excellent, impeccable service. Highly recommended."
Blanc,"Un superbe brunch le dimanche midi dans un cadre exceptionnel. Il existe une formule avec 3 boissons comprises, dont un cocktail a la passion. Tous les produits sont dune excellente qualite (jamon iberico, croquetas aux cepes, fromages varies, specialites libanaises). Mention speciale pour les patisseries et les desserts qui sont dignes dune grande patisserie. Cela fait une vraie difference avec dautres brunchs testes. Un axe de progres : proposer du the dans la formule et non pas en supplement, cest uqenf meme la base dun brunch (le cafe lui est inclus). Le cadre est exceptionnel, le service est aimable mais un peu guinde. Cependant, la qualite des produits compense le reste. Un point supplementaire, des rizs sont servis tout au long du brunch (vegetaux, cepes, poissons, etc...) donc ne pas se precipiter sur le premier."
Blanc,
Blanc,A great dinner with my wife. very good The only bad thing I would say is that the high back armchairs they have are a bit uncomfortable
Blanc,"We went for the pop-up that  Alapar  restaurant was serving at Blanc. The experience was absolutely amazing. Both chefs from Alapar restaurant were extremely attentive and involved in the dishes they prepared. The mix between mediterranean food and traditional japanese dishes is something that creates unbelievably good pieces such as the Toro Mushipan, that I ended ordering twice. I would definitely pay a visit to the Alapar restaurant, and probably another visit at Blanc whenever they change to a new pop-up!"
Blanc,"Dinner at the Blanc restaurant of the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona hotel as part of the Wine Dinner Series 2023 with the Gramona winery as a guest and with the presence of Xavier Gramona as the dinners master of ceremonies. On arrival a glass of Gramona Imperial Brut, 2017 while we meet the participants and Xavier welcomes us. Once at the table, the chefs table, right in front of the kitchen, we start dinner with a Fine de Claire oyster with pigeon juice and cherry with Gramona Innoble Brut Nature, NV. We continue with a pigeon croquette paired with the Gramona III Lustros Brut Nature, 2014. Then, the creamy rice with romesco, barat and Gordal olives. Paired with Gramona Celler Batlle Brut Nature, 2013. As a main course, wild sea bass with beurre blanc sauce, Perona beans and mussels with Gramona Enoteca Brut Nature, 2009. For dessert, trio of cocoa hazelnuts and coffee with Gramona Enoteca Brut, 2004 Coffee and petit fours. A magnificent experience and an incredible opportunity to listen to Xaviers explanations about the history of Gramona and the different sparkling wines we tasted. You can still book dinners with different wineries all this year. More information on the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona website."
Blanc,I called to make a reservation and they did not want to assist me since they were at breakfast... service not close to the hotels 5 stars
Blanc,
Blanc,"Two of us went to dinner during the gourmet walk and try the tasting menu. It must be said that we felt very comfortable from the moment we set foot in the restaurant thanks to the close and friendly treatment of all the staff. However, the food disappointed me a little, especially the Iberian Presa which was quite dry. It was a bit of a disappointment, honestly, because we loved the place."
Blanc,"Beau lieu, calme et distingue. Prix raisonnables, qualite des plats excellente."
Blanc,"No respect on the part of the waiters in general, both when staying, at breakfast time, and if you are going to have lunch or dinner occasionally. Despite being a regular at the Spa. The last time, a week ago, the waitress named Federica offended me when I was asking her to bring me a dish that she had put out of my reach - because she was injured and in one arm - calling me  old  and that she didnt have to put up with me. I tell Alberto responsible and he tells me that he doesnt believe me. No one, but no one from the hotel has apologized to me and told me when I ask for support:  He is meeting  or  he is meeting , deep down I must laugh at that behavior because with that attitude they think THEY ARE SUPERIOR WITH THAT HAUGHTY ATTITUDE, and no. They see that this lowers them as a hotel and as people. My relationship of so many years is a shame that it ended that way."
Blanc,"Good food, perfect service, nice place but 21 degrees in the room so we have been a bit cold (01/20/2022), like some other diners who also commented. They should review this issue to make the stay more pleasant, otherwise, perfect. Greetings"
Blanc,"Modern but charming place. The impressive large chairs that give a different air. The lunch menu of  45-60 seconds, delicious. I will be back for sure."
Blanc,"Un restaurant dont je ne garderais que du positif, l entree le plat et le dessert ont etes excellents. De meme pour le service du personnel qui est tres souriant et chaleureux. Pour tous les gouts, et abordables, ce fut une experience meritant 5 etoiles ! Je recommande vivement !"
Blanc,"Excellent dinner, fantastic service and very tasty dishes. The decoration, the atmosphere and the view are wonderful. If you want to spend a romantic night in Barcelona, dont hesitate and book now. We will be back!"
Blanc,
Blanc,"Irregular experience, dinner with a group of friends. The room is magnificent, large but cozy at the same time, I loved the decoration and the distribution of the tables. The dinner was good, fair quantities, good presentation although what I didnt expect was that dry rice was taken out in an individual paella pan as if it were in a beach bar, it threw me off. The service was not up to par, up to 4 different people served us, on two occasions we had to get up to serve ourselves cava because there was no one around (room less than 20% occupied) One of the waiters barely spoke Spanish (or Catalan), only English, honestly it doesnt seem right to me, I understand that the area is very touristy (Paseo de Gracia) but the natives are not an endangered breed. I dont recommend it, in the end  60 per head."
Blanc,
Blanc,
Blanc,
Blanc,"The menu leaves a lot to be desired, good price for the hotel category, but disappointing in flavor and preparation. The cod was tasteless, including the sauce, the beef was dry and chewy. The desserts and the very good attention of all the staff are saved. The place is very nice."
Blanc,"The bathrooms are not very clean. The cod we ate didnt taste like anything. The sweet beef was not sweet at all, I was very tired and nervous. Despite everything, the desserts are very good. Very good service and good atmosphere."
Blanc,"Seasonal menu for  38. First, second, dessert, drink and coffee. Quiet and elegant atmosphere on Paseo de Gracia (Mandarin Oriental Hotel). Very well served and quality products very well made. Ideal for a special occasion!"
Blanc,"Hey, Im a Timeout fan, then I read the Blanc Restaurant has a great Brunch! Great or? Landing in Barcelona the evening before, totally hungry and happy to go to the Blanc, walk there....... Then....got downstairs to the Restaurant... The Blanc was empty, with no customers, and the waiters send us the way, supposedly that Day(today) is not available outside Gast!!! Im sooooo pissss, never gone come back again on this place again!!!"
Blanc,Little outdated  but service is very good.. the price is reasonable
Blanc,"We had a WONDERFUL anniversary dinner. The excellent chef, the delicious food and the majestic service staff, the waitress was a luxury, Alberto was super cordial and Fredy was extremely professional. We will return without a celebration being necessary as an excuse since the best excuse is to enjoy the magic of Blanc again. Thanks for the surprise gift!!!!"
Blanc,A very nice place and the menu is pretty good.
Blanc,
Blanc,"You have to visit and eat one day at Blanc. Great service, rich and tasty food. And a great atmosphere! I would simply recommend this corner. Simple and generous dishes. I went in November and it was great since it was cloudy. For me the best restaurant to eat when we are in the area."
Blanc,Spectacular
Blanc,"Personally, the menu they offered us was disastrous. They didnt have cold beers, initially we reserved a menu that was not even close to what they gave us. Not recommended."
Blanc,"The Tavola de Blanc. Culinary experience that transports you to the Italian country. A single table in front of the kitchen where you can see how each dish is prepared. VERY good pizzas, everything was excellent."
Blanc,"Superb welcome and very professional service. On the other hand, the dishes were not up to the standards of a 5-star hotel. Cold main course and brownies, which is normally a safe bet, inedible"
Blanc,"Thank you for a wonderful birthday celebration lunch for my daughter. We all had a wonderful time. Special thanks to Edouard and his team at the Blanc including Luigi and Federica. The food was delicious particularly the lamb, very tender. The kids love the birthday cake surprise. Many thanks again!"
Blanc,Service 6/5 Vin   5/5 Food 1/5 Very disappointed by the quality of the food.. I still don t understand how such a place can offer such a bad food
Blanc,
Blanc,"Excellent price quality, tasty and well-executed food, wonderful staff attention, always attentive to the diner, cozy and intimate place. Restaurant to recommend. The only (but) is that they take a long time between courses, and the emptiness that occurs in that period is boring. I will be back"
Blanc,"Had an absolutely fabulous lunch here. The hotel and restaurant are drop dead gorgeous...staff was amazingly friendly and fun, our waitress was fantastic. The food was great, the croquettes were delicious, the carrots soup was sooooo flavorful, the lamb surf and turf was delicious and the turbot was amazing. Loved the wine recommendation and the dessert was so good. For 38  this is a steal, and I will be back soon."
Blanc,Menu at 38 euros!
Blanc,
Blanc,"I love it!!! Good service, good place and delicious food to be with friends and family!!!"

Blanc,Nice restaurant
Blanc,Good attentive service and very good food. Everything perfect Thank you so much!!
Blanc,"A great restaurant with perfect hospitality We had the very fine seasonal menu Everything is perfect, the setting, the welcome, the meal, dont hesitate"
Blanc,
Blanc,Correct menu.
Blanc,"Excellent, very attentive and friendly staff, varied and careful menu. Very good."
Blanc,
Blanc,
Blanc,Mol be the.exquisite food but the wine 3xesively expensive and they didnt bring us the wine list the.posyre exceptional
Blanc,Great value for the price
Blanc,La Carme Ruscalleda always makes very exquisite dishes
Blanc,"I havent dined there. We went for a cocktail. I must say it was very good, but the price outrageous. The cheapest beer at 6 euros and the next one which is nothing out of the world at 8. Cafe 5 euros. A Cacaolat that was half a glass, 5 euros and the cocktail 16 euros. We paid for the tour. Maybe we will go there for dinner one day but never again for a drink."
Blanc,Great Sunday menu. I recommend it. Everything works perfect. Thanks to all the workers.
Blanc,Top-notch dining experience.
Blanc,
Blanc,
Blanc,"The quality is very good, but the quantity is fair. Of course, the exceptional service."
Blanc,"Christmas Day menu  139 per diner plus  45 in a bottle of wine; The service was fair, no one spoke Catalan, the reservation disappeared and the receptionist resolved it very badly, the girl asking us what the name of who served us was as if she were writing down all the names... It seemed to me that the menu was not up to the expectations. expectations that they generate for a very high price. Nothing is surprising, they left the last dessert that we claimed was nougat and neulas and we are still waiting for the neulas. I do not recommend this culinary experience, what a shame that they use the name of Ruscalleda as a claim. Disappointing although not horrible, very flat we will not return. Merry Christmas."
Blanc,
Blanc,
Blanc,"We ate Carmes menu, elaborate and quality cuisine, I was surprised that none of the staff speak Catalan and they barely understand it."
Blanc,
Blanc,Better to go without expectations
Blanc,"The food is mediocre (boiled noodles and mayonnaise instead of allioli, custard with burnt sugar sold as crema Catalana, are just a few examples). We had to wait more than two hours even though we had a reservation.,Ah! And nobody speaks Catalan. Where is Carmen Ruscalleda? None White; all dark Come in to see the hotel and save yourself a bad time - which is expensive."
Blanc,"exquisite at all levels quality, cleanliness, service I recommend it we tried the menu and we loved it"
Blanc,"The experience was not what was expected, in these places the portions are scarce, but the quality? We were only favorably surprised by the coca, the rest of the average dishes and even some tasteless ones. The staff lacks experience, they brought us the starters before the drink, they were not attentive to serving the wine and they brought us the bill in the middle of the desserts. Much to improve."
Blanc,"Very good food, excellent service, minus the head chef (the person behind the counter organizing the waiters) and WEARING HIS MASK DOWN all the time, even when putting the bread on the tray, I feel like a a bit hypocritical for them to ask for a covid passport and have someone in the kitchen, organizing the food that goes on the tables, working with the mask down."
Fast Kibuka,"We always order online. He is always perfect, but this Tuesday was not as usual. The makis were a little more resected, they stuck a little when you wanted to separate them and they broke. But still super good!"
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,Wonderful onigiri with avocado! The people working here are always friendly and helpful
Fast Kibuka,"The food is the same price as in the restaurant, which is ridiculous since it wasn t fresh at all and they said it was prepared in the morning. The fish had a weird smell and noodles were soggy, very unpleasant experience for a takeaway that I paid 60  for Food"
Fast Kibuka,We went this afternoon and the guy who helped us explained everything perfectly. Excellent quality/price. I will be back.
Fast Kibuka,"We wanted to try the delivery option for the first time. The quality is lower than that of the restaurant, especially the Yakisoba that had pieces of chicken nerves and bones. Prices are higher through the Gloovo app. Answer: Nobody has said anything about heating because we did it as indicated on the tupperware. What is not normal, no matter how fresh the chicken is, is that we only find that, bones and nerves, chicken only had the name of the dish."
Fast Kibuka,"I love ordering food delivery from Kibuka. It saves me many dinners when I dont feel like cooking  . They have a different menu than the restaurant because they ensure that the food arrives in perfect condition and, therefore, they do not serve food that may arrive softened or dishes that must be finished cooking at home. The service is very fast and the food arrives in a few minutes despite being outside the neighborhood."
Fast Kibuka,Great sushi!
Fast Kibuka,Very expensive and the sushi just right
Fast Kibuka,"Perfect Japanese takeout place. There is always a variety of prepared dishes such as sushi rolls, yakisoba, onigiri, and more."
Fast Kibuka,"Dear customer service team, I would like to file a complaint about my recent order number #77012. Unfortunately, the yakisoba we ordered arrived in an unpleasant state and was clearly spoiled. The food was spoiled and inedible. Since the quality of the product delivered did not meet expectations, I kindly request a full refund for the yakisoba. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt response to resolve this situation. Thank you for your attention and prompt action."
Fast Kibuka,Its very good but I find the prices quite high for home delivery sushi.
Fast Kibuka,Japanese cuisine of a high standard and at a reasonable price. I will repeat!
Fast Kibuka,"I went for takeout There was also a bar chair where I could have a quick meal, so I ate there. You can also heat it in the microwave. The staff was friendly and very nice Go when youre craving food"
Fast Kibuka,I go there very often. I love it. Its good fast food.
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"I edit the review because it has not been published, apparently because it is false. My review is based on a real experience: If you decide to eat there and what you want is prepared, they ask you to take it from the refrigerator. This means that you end up eating excessively cold sushi that doesnt have much flavor. A shame."
Fast Kibuka,"I have been going to Fast Kibuka regularly for 5 years, I used to work nearby and used to buy food every week, the noodles are not my favorite but I love the rest (the salad in sesame sauce is very delicious, the gyoza too). The sushi is almost always made to order, a couple of times it happened to me that it didnt seem very fresh, perhaps because it had already been made for a few hours, but the quality of the ingredients is also high. Yesterday we ordered delivery and were surprised by the speed of delivery and the quality of the salmon. We will repeat, as always!"
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Different menu from the restaurant. Complicated navigation, it could be much better or just in case it is not your business, there are companies that are dedicated exclusively, called delivery"
Fast Kibuka,Excellent product and punctual delivery. Highly recommended
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Very good, but if you arrive at 11pm kitchen closed"
Fast Kibuka,"We knew the restaurant and today we entered for the first time. The guy who served us advised us very well with the daily menu, the service was perfect and the food was delicious. We will definitely repeat!"
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Very good quality. When it is at home, fast delivery and in good condition. We have also been frequenting one of their restaurants for many years. Very very good, very friendly service, very good value for money."
Fast Kibuka,"The quality of the sushi is very good, especially the sashimi of 10. In addition, the delivery service is super fast!"
Fast Kibuka,"Fine sushi, good value for money, consistent quality."
Fast Kibuka,"My favorite for many years but unfortunately we will not order again. There is no consistency. Sometimes very good and other times very bad, not being able to eat it. Asking is taking a gamble."
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,Poor quality . The yakisoba are worse than envelopes and at exorbitant prices
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,One of the best Japanese takeaway options in the area. They have a fast and efficient delivery service. It is true that it may be more expensive than a Sino-Japanese but the quality is much better. Some dishes need to be heated when you get home.
Fast Kibuka,"Really Delicious! I really enjoyed the combos they had, portions that fill you up at a good price, I would definitely repeat every day. Also, the guy was super nice and nice giving us more wasabi."
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,The true fission of the Mediterranean with Japan. Excellent place to take food home.
Fast Kibuka,This option is good for faster sushi. I think the prices are a little high but the product is very good.
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Once again FANTASTIC!!!!!! Great quality, perfect workmanship, abundant quantity! We have tried several Japos and the one at KIBUKA is by far the BEST!!!! Yesterday one of the diners is Japanese and she was surprised by the GREAT QUALITY!!!!! The price is very correct and other cheaper ones have nothing to do with Fast Kibuka."
Fast Kibuka,Sushi acceptable quality/price but the place was very hot   ... The workers were very friendly and the place was clean.
Fast Kibuka,Poor quality. Gyozas and edamames cold from the refrigerator. Mediocre sushi. Much difference compared to the normal Kibuka.
Fast Kibuka,Quality Japanese food at a good price. Takeaway only. I recommend Aburi Uramaki and daily menu for  10.5 and 3 courses with drink
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Long loyal, now the Onigiris are a new hit"
Fast Kibuka,"I dont know if it happened because we ordered early and they sent us makos that had been in the fridge for a long time but it all came together, the tataki tuna was medium gray, the yakisoba with super thick noodles... nothing to do with the other times or with the restaurant... .. I hope it was something punctual since they have always had quality... a shame but it wasnt good at all..."
Fast Kibuka,delishious Spanish sushi
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Little Fast, Quite a Kibuka. Go to the restaurant or pick it up. An hour and a half of waiting, paying  5, free and Fast if you are from Eixample or Gracia, a shame."
Fast Kibuka,"The delivery logistics should be improved, it is not the first time they have called me to cancel an order after waiting 1 hour explaining that they have a computer error. In return, the quality of the sushi is very good and they were nice enough to compensate us with some free pieces."
Fast Kibuka,Been my lunch time food provider for 7 years...geaet set menu Monday to Friday 9.5 euro
Fast Kibuka,"You can stop by and buy your shusi and if you dont want to leave home, you order it online and in doing so you are giving work to the Fast Kibuka delivery drivers. Very good quality in their products."
Fast Kibuka,Excellent Japanese with a very agile home service.
Fast Kibuka,"Everything perfect, the girls changed some dishes to make them vegan and everything was very good. The Friday menu is very very good."
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"The truth is that it is very good... you can see the quality of the ingredients, it is true that the price is a little high but it makes up for the quality. I am always happy whenever I can and the variety and originality of the dishes is very high. I just think they should expand the cheaper delivery donut a little more."
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Good Japanese food (sushi, yakisoba, guiozas,...) to take away. The quality/price ratio 4/5."
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Kings night 9.19pm order arrived at 10.55pm after several calls, passing the responsibility to the delivery person. The delivery man denies it. They do not solve it in any way 60th order. Im sorry but the first and the last. At least some solution or compensation."
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,"Good quality, like in the restaurant. Everything is very rich."
Fast Kibuka,All very good!
Fast Kibuka,"Excellent, very good service and quality."
Fast Kibuka,Great
Fast Kibuka,Quality sushi and fast ordering
Fast Kibuka,"Clear, simple and easy website. Excellent delivery, just right wait time and great food! A great option to eat at home!"
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,Came here because of a Reddit post. Taste is below average and definitely expensive.
Fast Kibuka,"I ordered for home delivery. The flambeed salmon uramaki was delicious. The spicy tuna is also very good. The tuna tataki is a bit weak. There was a delay in delivery, but they called me several times indicating it, it is appreciated. Correct price, I will order again without a doubt!"
Fast Kibuka,"We have taken away from Fast Kibuka once a week for more than a year now. It seems more expensive compared to competition but the taste and quality is unbeatable and definitely worth it. After eating there I became really picky and am not satisfied with many other sushi places that I used to like, it has become a real benchmark for me. Highly recommended!"
Fast Kibuka,"Good, but a bit expensive"
Fast Kibuka,Good place to go for good quality takeaway sushi. Highly recommended. They also offer home service.
Fast Kibuka,"Uramaki mint. If I go it is for the uramaki mint, which drives me crazy. But, in general, the quality-price ratio is not very good. Too expensive to be a pick up and go. We like it to take away the sushi whim. I do not recommend dishes that have to be heated because, although they are not bad, they are obviously not freshly made and it shows. Noodles are addictive but only because the main ingredient is glutamate. The staff is very cordial and friendly. And it should also be noted that they minimize the use of plastic. They package the food in compostable material, which I then reuse as pots."
Fast Kibuka,"As always, Kibuka nails it. Fast, good food and excellent presentation."
Fast Kibuka,"It is not the restaurant but it is still one of the best takeaway sushi in the city with a range of proposals that ranges from classics to more alternative pieces. A trick for those who dont like the maki to be already made, if you arrive at a good time or ask for something that they dont have in the display cases they will make it for you right away."
Fast Kibuka,Spectacular sushi and super fast and efficient home delivery.
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,Its our go-to sushi and it never fails.
Fast Kibuka,"We are very happy with Fast Kibuka. Food quality and formality in delivery. By the way, since they have changed the payment method. Having ALL the correct information, I have not been able to place the order By"
Fast Kibuka,I love it!!!
Fast Kibuka,Very good Japanese.
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,
Fast Kibuka,A must in our dinner rotation at home when we want Japanese
Fast Kibuka,"We are very satisfied, both with the food on offer and the quality. And also the complements (soy sauce, wasabi, etc.) The diligence in the home service is unbeatable."
Fast Kibuka,"Its good (although nothing like the sushi they serve in the restaurant). This time I ordered home delivery and the delivery service is super fast. I understand that they already have it prepared, and this makes the rice too cold and breaks when picking up the pieces. For the price you pay, it should be like in the restaurant, made to order. Even so, it is good, but for the price you pay, it is better that they take a little longer to deliver it, but that it is made at the moment, 100% like Verdis kibuka."
Fast Kibuka,Bester Sushi take away in town. Highly recommended
Fast Kibuka,
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Good good and vegan friendly
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","A hidden essential in Gracia. The quality of each ingredient, the variety of a very complete and nutritious menu with options for all tastes and, above all, the love, both in the preparation of the dishes and in the service, make this place a true oasis. I still dont understand how a simple egg and infusion can be made so deliciously. I wish they were open on weekends too! Ill be back soon, thank you!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Highly recommended, they are women who treat you with great care, you can see the love in their dishes, in the attention and in the atmosphere."

"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Quite a discovery! Healthy food lovers: this is the place. The space is gorgeous, the girls are charming, and the food... a spectacle. Gluten-free, sugar-free and cooked with a lot of love. They change the menu every week. Looking forward to trying all the dishes. Ah! They have a keto option. Menu of the day at 4:50 p.m. that includes a vegetable cream, main course and water. Wonderful."

"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Ufff super delicious!! Everything is great
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Coming to Maai is always to feel that you are being looked after, healthy and super tasty, creative cuisine, combination of flavors cooked in xupxup, not simple salads.. and the treatment: as excellent as the cuisine!! This week I went to their cooking workshop, you leave with a lot of knowledge that they share with you and the pleasure of tasting all their proposals, a highly recommended luxury! Dietary restrictions: I am celiac and have multiple food intolerances and at Maai I have no problems choosing."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Great !!!!!
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I have visited this fine dining restaurant several times. The menu changes every week, making every visit a unique experience. The ingredients are of the highest quality and we try to be 0 km, which guarantees fresh and delicious food. In addition, the menus are low in carbohydrates, which makes it an excellent choice for those looking to take care of their health. What really impressed me was the master class they did yesterday on anti-inflammatory cooking. An intense class because of the number of dishes they cooked and because of all the information added by Viki, the cook. Everything seemed very professional to me. The service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and attentive at all times. In short, I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a different dining experience than other restaurants."

"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Super attentive and perfect food!
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",I just moved to Barcelona and found this restaurant that offers the foods I like. I have only tried 4 dishes that are not only healthy but also delicious! I pick up my lunch every day and Im sorry theyre not open on the weekend. Thank you Maai for offering such an exquisite menu! I love my lunches
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","They treated me badly for asking for the menu in Catalan, which is tiring"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Delicious and very healthy food. Good treatment and atmosphere. I love it and I repeat whenever I can!
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","LE: Edited to add that missing star  Visited again and I had a wonderful lubina with leek spaghetti which deserves all the stars out there :) And their poke bowl was awesome too, cannot wait to come back and try more food! Very nice place for a healthy and rather different meal. All the options on the menu seemed well balanced and with nutritious ingredients. Unfortunately, I was not able to try the dish I had in mind, as it was finished. However, both the burger with chickpea waffle and the microbiotic bowl were nice. One star less because, for my taste, the food was very salty. The pumpkin and cacao truffle was out of this world. So incredibly smooth, yet crunchy but thin layer of chocolate. The service was nice and the atmosphere was calm and relaxing. Would recommend for a pleasant lunch stop."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",The best healthy restaurant in Barcelona
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I like the concept and the place seems nice to me but in my opinion a small cream (very good) and a single dish was insufficient for  16.50 considering that they give you tap water for drinks and you dont get dessert. Speaking of water, I would like to comment that they should clean the reusable bottles from time to time because it was very noticeable that they do not do so. Attached image. Otherwise good, the food is very good and the initiative of giving cooking workshops at the premises seems great to me. For someone who wants to eat healthy and quality, I see it as a good option if you are just in that area, but I would not specifically go."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",An explosion of flavor. Lovely deal and place.
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Beautiful place, different....and healthy and exceptionally delicious food. Dont be too many to come....its my secret!!!!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Delicious healthy breakfast - thank you so much!

"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Very tasty food. As a starter for the lunch menu there was a tomato peach gazpacho with beetroot. Main course was also great. Very very nice service! Perfect
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","A great place to eat healthy and natural, a clean and comfortable place"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Healthy and good food. They take intolerances into account. There are two menu-type formulas: Keto and Lunch, where you can choose a main dish, at the price of  16.50 (its a bit expensive considering that its a single dish and only includes filtered water; neither desserts, nor other drinks, nor coffee). We went as a group and everything we ordered was well done and good. The venue was full and there was a lot of chatter, but perhaps the most negative thing was the heat: unbearable! They dont have air conditioning. And the fans were not even noticeable. Vegetarian options: Several dishes are vegetarian: the creams, the formulas and the desserts."

"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",11 out of 10! Spectacular and healthy food  they have a keto option and always gluten
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Mmmmmmm!!! I couldnt stop doing this while eating! Spectacular, healthy and the girls are charming. I give it a 10!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Excellent food and service. We really liked the lunch proposals. Its not cheap ( 39 for 2 people, a starter+main each and shared dessert) but its worth it for the quality and the fact that youre eating healthy. The attention is also very good. We dont give 5 stars because they only had the cards printed in Spanish, and in Catalan they told us they had to print it, which surprised us considering that both the staff and most of the customers spoke Catalan. Surely this can be easily corrected and in the next one we can put the 5 stars!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","A space where you can take care of your diet with vegetarian proposals and others that incorporate protein such as salmon. They have a weekday lunch menu, a pleasant atmosphere and very good service. In the photo the chickpea waffle with open omelette, burrata and arugula, a complete and delicious dish."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","The food was incredible, I was looking forward to trying more things. The attention was also very pleasant. They are out of the ordinary."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","A quiet, familiar place. Careful attention and quality and healthy food."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Perfect place for healthy and tasty dishes. The food is very good and very original. The service is very attentive and close. I highly recommend the place for lunch.
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Healthy, varied, and different food. Good choice to take care of yourself during the week, although the keto dish is a little expensive compared to the other more substantial menu and includes a cream. However, everything was very delicious."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Delicious, fresh, healthy food and very friendly service. I would happily recommend!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Of all the places I have eaten at in Barcelona, Maai is clearly the crown jewel! Tugged away in a quintessential Spanish bylane. As the door opens, you immediately get the gauge of the inviting. expanse of the pastel restaurant. And that expanse is just true about the two lovely owners. The genuine care is unmissable. Gorgeous food with a menu that turns every week! Maai must be top of your list as you get here"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I liked the choices of gluten free, and vegetarian option."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Healthy and very tasty. Everything was delicious!!!
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Brutal, exquisite quality, combination of flavors and textures. A 10."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I love the place, I go with my friend Bea every 2 weeks and its always great. Ps: the waffles are amazing although everything is good"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","The site is nice, the service is excellent and the quality of the product seemed good to me, but it is very expensive and the relationship between quality, quantity and price is disproportionate. I would consider other options before repeating."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I went today for the 1st time with a friend and we loved it!!! Cozy place and very clean. Dealing with all the wonderful staff and the dishes pure craftsmanship, you notice the dedication, passion and professionalism. I would need more stars, they deserve more"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Delicious food and unbeatable service!
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","How well we ate, and how good the service! Place to repeat without a doubt!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Vegetarian options: Fabuloso menu!!! Recommendation for vegetarians
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","The experience at Maai has to be lived, it is food made with a lot of love and it shows when you eat it. Top quality products and very well thought out dishes. Thank you for taking care of us so much"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",

"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",A very good option to go for lunch during the week. Very good food and lovely service. Dont miss the dessert truffles.
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","We found MAAI when searching online for a gluten free restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and our waitress more than willing to accommodate food sensitivities. Our lunch was creative a unique combination of flavors and textures and delicious. The complementary pumpkin soup so good and the lemon, ginger, turmeric water was both refreshing and invigorating. Highly recommend! They are open for breakfast and lunch and reservations are recommended."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Excellent place and treatment. The food is very good and they care about any intolerance you may have.
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","The place is cool. Food is delicious, the veg cream was wonderful and the cod and waffle were from another world. Service very attentive. We will come back to try new recipes."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Healthy quality food
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Super different and healthy. I liked it a lot, I will repeat without a doubt"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I have come several times to eat at Maai, I must admit that I was not entirely convinced about eating so healthy thinking that the dishes would lack flavor or would not fill me up... but I was completely wrong! At maai you will eat well, you will leave satisfied and all their dishes are tasty! A total success. I will repeat. Vegetarian options: They have vegan options on their menu, both for dishes and desserts. Dietary restrictions: All dishes are gluten-free and there are lactose-free options."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","A nice place with friendly service and an interesting menu. However, the breakfast waffle disappointed me a bit because there was more arugula in it than the waffle itself :)"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I think I ve found a new favourite place. What a gem! I ve never felt so  safe  anywhere. Everything they serve is gluten free and the options are really delicious. I ve had the chickpeas waffle with omelette, smoked aubergine, burrata and cherry tomatoes was exquisite. The place is very nice and cozy and the service are the kindest. Definitely will be going back."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I have literally never eaten better in my life. It was very very very good, congratulations because it is amazing."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Restaurant with dishes cooked with great care and as healthy as any! Very correct service and quality/price of the daily menu and the best dishes in the neighborhood
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Everything is so delicious, the place and the people are also excellent"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","A different place, for a different food. They know very well the current low-carbohydrate diets and they advise you and explain both the dishes and the infusions (if you are fasting, for example). The waitress was very nice and attentive. Highly recommended!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","The portions are correct, it tastes very good. Right price. Very rich ginger water. Excellent location. For celiac people it is a good option. The place is well decorated, but has very little natural light. The flavor is excellent and the quality of the products is very good. They only have meals, it is not a place for coffee or snacks."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Une tres belle decouverte! Une cuisine saine et pleine de saveurs, cetait delicieux !"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I really like this restaurant. Its a pity that they have raised the price of the menu, which I can understand given the way life is, although that is precisely why I will be able to go less. The food is quality and it is one of the few places I leave without having bad digestion. I would love for them to use a little less oil and salt. And if you can, some poles with cheaper options wouldnt be bad."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant as a solo diner post peak lunch hours. When I arrived, the hostess asked if I was dining with another person. When I confirmed that I was alone, only then did she claim that everything was reserved, even though there were multiple smaller tables available, and she tried to seat me on a stool facing the wall instead. I felt like the restaurant was prioritizing seat availability over providing a comfortable dining experience for its customers... even though the chances of it filling up in the following hour were very low. Just felt opportunistic and not very cool."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Exquisite food . Quick service and very attentive waitresses. I recommend 100%.
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",Great
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","THE FOOD IS SPECTACULAR. Good, healthy and delicious."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Quality, Original and Good food! We love to come every week and eat healthy and balanced. With original proposals that change every week. Very good atmosphere. Like home."
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Since the waitress didnt know us, she passed on us. We waited twice as long as other people and had much more personalized attention with other tables (we were surprised that he preferred weekend updates over attending to any of our signals). On the other hand, we were not used to their type of food and when we had doubts about a dish they treated us with disdain. I gave it two stars because the food tasted good with quality ingredients. Price higher than expected. I will not repeat"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food",
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Brutally delicious. Attention, cleanliness and kindness. We will be back!!!"
"Maai, Healthy & Real Food","Nice place, exquisite service and the Keto dish with extra protein was the best choice!! I wish they accepted pets! Vegetarian options: A good alternative for vegetarians and with a keto option!"

Habib's Village,"The restaurant is base on Pakistani cusine, we went for dinner when we were visiting Barcelona and ordered multiple things. Chef s special chicken karahi was amazing and very delicious, the naam were made fresh and very tasty. We also ordered perishable peri chicken and it was also very tasty. The russian salad is not what you would expect as a Pakistani, and it was just below average, we also ordered mutton biryani and I wouldn t recommend it as it did not taste fresh. Overall was a very nice experience."

Habib's Village,"Absolutely worst place. No service, even with booking and tables available they make us wait. Raw meat, pathetic fat man instead of fixing the issue at the time of after he told us no table is available and he make us sit in playing area. We are never coming again for sure. Absolutely worst experience, not recommended"

Well, if a small tapper with 3 pieces of chicken with a lot of sauce and 3 pieces of bread, as you can see in the photo, has a value of  15, you are VERY EXPENSIVE."

Habib's Village,"The worst Indian in Barcelona for food and service. The chicken curry was more like a strange soup with boiled chicken. The vegetarian dishes where so salty, to the point one was utterly inedible. If that wasn t bad enough the service was also diabolical."

Habib's Village,"The only Indian buffet I have ever seen. You wonder if it can be good, if its worth daring to dream or if it will just add another bitter disappointment to the list. As you can guess from the little stars, it lived up to my wild expectations and then some. Very good service, affordable price, great billiards and, of course, an excellent buffet with delicious Indian food, available from the first minute. The selection is not incredibly extensive, but very well chosen. I would recommend it to all people on planet Earth. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian options"

Las Muns,The baked empanadas are very tasty. And with your purchase you get coffee with milk for  1 so I took advantage and accompanied my mushroom empanada   Alejo was super friendly and we talked while I ate because the place was quiet. I will return because it is close to work and the smell of freshly baked goods is tempting.

Las Muns,"Stefany has been very attentive, and the Muns have always been my favorite empanadas"
Restaurant La Forquilla,The tasting menu is well worth it.
Restaurant La Forquilla,"We went for lunch and it was a very pleasant experience. We made the tasting menu. All very good, very good presentation in a relaxed atmosphere We recommend it!!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,Very very highly recommended!!
Restaurant La Forquilla,The fork never disappoints. To enjoy with each dish.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Incredible experience! One man restaurant with very high quality
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Great discovery, tasting menu, phenomenal, everything very good"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Fantastic place with excellent food and a very cozy atmosphere. They took great care of us. It is worth going slowly, tasting all the dishes calmly to appreciate the care with which the chef has prepared them. Ultra recommended!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"A great discovery and a great gastronomic experience. Highlight the close treatment of the chef, who explains each dish in detail and is interested in its result. The tasting menu is highly recommended."
Restaurant La Forquilla,A tasting menu that has nothing to envy of a Michelin star. Sit back and enjoy in a quiet environment.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Amazing food. Very nice presentation and taste combinations. What makes all more amazing that it is a one man show. A great find and a great experience.
Restaurant La Forquilla,excellent
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,Excellent tasting menu with pairings very well selected by the chef.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Astonishing food experience! Even more when you realize that everything is played by a one man band!
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Small, cozy restaurant, not loud, designed to focus on the food and not on the decoration. Innovative proposals, some daring. And you may not like that. Spending on the cooking point of a sea bass and accompanying it with sweet garnish, for example, is not liked. But overall its worth it. Fantastic service, unbeatable. The price, excessive. If the kitchen fine tunes a little more, they have a great future."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Restaurant with a closed menu, a lot of attention from the owner, he is a true artist. He advised the pairing. He is alone, he does all the service, he cooks, everyone with a lot of sense with a lot of attention, he is not slow, he is very attentive. We all left delighted, it really is a different restaurant and worth trying."

Restaurant La Forquilla,"We ordered the tasting menu and it was a perfect choice! Every dish was served in a perfect manner, and the taste was very delicate. They were visually asthetic as well. The chef explained every dish and kindly hosted us. It was a great experience, and we would like to come again. Worth the money! Highly recommend this place."
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Great restaurant. Perfect atmosphere and unbeatable service. The food, you simply have to go there to discover it."
Restaurant La Forquilla,A fantastic texture and flavor experience. We made the tasting menu Do not miss it! I will return for sure Thanks Chef
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Yesterday we went there for lunch with a group of friends, a very nice place to enjoy little noise because the place offers ideal diners. We did the tasting menu, we were surprised by the smells and flavors. I absolutely recommend it."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"It is perfection itself. The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect, but All courses and paired wines I could feel the chefs creativity and sincerity. Next time you come to Barcelona I will definitely come back. Thank you so much for making it such a happy experience."
Restaurant La Forquilla,An elaborate and quality meal with good service and good atmosphere
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Great food, with a lot of flavor and at the same time fine, dishes with creativity, unbeatable service, the chef, waiter, sommelier..... is a real crack, congratulations."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Incredible tasting menu made by Vidal, who took care of every detail ALONE (I admire his cooking and his service). Quiet place for a special and unforgettable evening. I highlight the scallop and the suckling pig.... uffffffgggg. Experience worth living      Congratulations!!!!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Had a wonderful meal at La Forquilla. The food was excellent, the chef was very personable, and made great recommendations. This restaurant clearly comes from a place of great passion, and we loved our experience."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Loved my experience there. Its a one man show and i can understand sometimes that can be overwhelming but maybe a little bit more patience is required on the owners part when dealing with clients who dont speak English, Spanish or Catalan. The food was excellent, the attention to detail is there. I love how its not super loud inside and you can chill have a great time. It was my cousins birthday and he even suprised her with a birthday treat while juggling his kitchen and orders. So he does make you feel special. I highly recommend this place and try to understand that its one person doing everything and sometimes that does not leave them much time to spend at your table. But the food is outstanding"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Three friends were there because of a reference we had on the radio and we took advantage of the visit to Barcelona. We were surprised and liked the decoration and the atmosphere (music at an appropriate volume). We ordered the great tasting menu. The original and quality wine list. We liked the wines a lot. The cook, who also waits on the tables, was very correct and efficient. In short, a highly recommended restaurant."
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,We really enjoyed the chefs creativity and excellent raw materials.
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Small and fine restaurant. The chef serves himself and explains the dishes. The tasting menu was excellent. Wed love to come back. Even more than a year later, we ate great food again. The restaurant is definitely on our agenda for our next visit to Barcelona."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Fabulous experience, from start to finish! If I had to change anything it would be the decor of the walls, and perhaps dimming the lights somewhat. The most important thing is however the food, which is AMAZING! Food : 5/5"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"An amazing one man show, really unforgettable experience in terms of both food and service!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,Nous avons passe une soiree incroyable avec un cuisinier qui travaille tout seule dans son restaurant. Cetait sublime
Restaurant La Forquilla,"A unique experience. A restaurant where reception, service, preparation and payment are done by one and the same person and where it is also super tasty. Never experienced. An absolute must! I am a fan."
Restaurant La Forquilla,Excellent food and service
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Unbeatable 50th birthday gift!!!! I couldnt say which dish I liked the most, starters, seconds and spectacular desserts."
Restaurant La Forquilla,Take advantage while it has no star . then it will be impossible. Optimum in every way
Restaurant La Forquilla,"The restaurant is clean, minimalist and moderately elegant. The food and quality ingredients are noticeable in cooked to the point. But in this concept of I stew it, I eat it (that is, the cook acts as a waiter, sommelier and waiter), which is very good, the chef should be more empathetic, kinder, warmer in short, closer. . The concept without closeness and sincere kindness does not work. It may be that that day was a hard day, therefore we will give it another chance because the Chef and the restaurant itself deserve it, as long as that feeling between diner and Chef is better."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Not only was the food, beautiful and delicious, but it was playful and surprising. The tasting menu is a must definitely get the wine pairing you re gonna be so floored when you try it."
Restaurant La Forquilla,Spectacular. Everything is very rich.
Restaurant La Forquilla,All excellent dishes. Food made with pleasant flavors and nuances that stand out. The entire restaurant is run by only one person. Reservation essential. Wheelchair accessibility: Ground floor without steps to access. Tables with plenty of space for wheelchairs.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Recommended experience. Exquisite tasting menu. And exceptional service. Taking into account that the same person is chef and waiter...it is organized super well.
Restaurant La Forquilla,"This was a very special and unique dining experience. The chef, a talented one-man show, crafted a mouth-watering menu paired with exquisite wines. The quality of food and service was outstanding, and the overall value was exceptional!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Good place to go to eat, very good food, super friendly staff, 10"
Restaurant La Forquilla,Unique site. Quite an experience. Highly recommended.
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Amazing experience! The chef runs the entire restaurant on his own and manages to keep the patrons happy! The wine pairing was an excellent choice and probably amounted to 3 or 4 glasses in total. Also very reasonably priced. Lastly, he was able to accommodate last minute dietary restrictions with ease, which was great because I should have mentioned during the time I made the reservation."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Very good experience. We dont know the rte and today we went to lunch. We ate a la carte, there is also an interesting tasting menu, and all the dishes were delicious and of high quality. L, delicious crayfish and green bean rice. Impeccable presentation and very good service. The professionalism and intention of the diners was noticeable we feel pampered Well be coming back."
Restaurant La Forquilla,I wish I can give more than 5 stars on my review. Really impressed by the solo culinary show hosted by the chef = the owner = who serves you. Tried the tasting menu - a combination of all great ingredients with love and dedication from the chef and his creativity. Recommend to all who visits Barcelona!
Restaurant La Forquilla,Had fun. Came here per a recommendation and my wife and I enjoyed the food. The wine selection was great too Vegetarian options: My wife got some vegetarian food. Just make sure you give the owner notice when making your reservations
Restaurant La Forquilla,I was eating and I loved the food!!!
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Vidal is so welcoming, what a star. He was cooking for us while explaining the menu and serving. We were highly impressed by the food and service, he really made us feel at home. I would recommend doing the tasting menu with matching wines, I would order every dish again. Also great value for money."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"When you work with passion the result is impeccable, a pleasure for the senses, Good product and good work. A great discovery, we will be back!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,Stunning. Quite how Vidal delivers everything I have no idea but the result is superb. Everything was great but the Pork dish and Coconut dessert were the best of their types I have ever had. Exceptional.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Magnifique je recommande.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Excellent attention and quality!
Restaurant La Forquilla,"This restaurant is a gem, inconspicuous location for one of the best culinary experiences I ve had in Barcelona. Major thanks to the chef for the exquisite play with flavours and textures, and for the warm service."
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,"A pearl, delicious, welcoming and fair prices. Wheelchair accessibility: Flat entry."
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,I recommend it 100x100. From the first dish to the last. All incredible. Looking forward to returning
Restaurant La Forquilla,Quiet and pleasant atmosphere. The very elaborate and original tasting menu. The cook is the one who serves and has everything planned. Exquisite service and very original and carefully prepared dishes. Excellent value for money.
Restaurant La Forquilla,impressive I ate the tasting menu and we loved it. Everything very accurate. The boy very attentive as I could not eat some foods and honey has changed. Super recommended.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Quiet and well cooked
Restaurant La Forquilla,The food is exquisite and the service excellent. It is always a pleasure to return.
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Probably the most valuable culinary experience we ve had in Barcelona. There is so much love and attention to detail being put in the food, the ingredients are top notch, the flavors and textures are exceptional, yet simplicity is key in most of the plates. Truly unique, not to be missed. Big bravo to Chef and owner Vidal, his passion and dedication to his cooking is inspiring. Keep it up!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Interesting place due to the service format and quality of the product produced. The cook is both the one who attends and serves the diners. Minimalist and cozy place, it would improve the ambient light giving it greater warmth and the coverings to improve acoustic comfort. We will repeat to try the tasting menu!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Great cuisine and very nice atmosphere.  Although the chef handles everything by himself, he serves dish just after they are prepared.  Enjoyed every dish."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Excellent impeccable menu,"
Restaurant La Forquilla,An original approach. The cook himself serves the tables which are well separated. The place could become endearing if the chefs attitude was warmer. It can occasionally be disrespectful. The right food.
Restaurant La Forquilla,Thank you for a really nice evening with super delicious dishes and exquisite wines! Can definitely be recommended
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Very chill atmosphere, few tables, delicious tasting menu. The owner does all the functions, cooks, waits on tables and gets paid. Its very close"
Restaurant La Forquilla,"We had the tasting menu with wine pairing. Each course was creative, beautiful, and delicious -- easily the best fine dining experience I had during my stay in Barcelona."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"I have very good references! It is my next restaurant, without a doubt!!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,"This restaurant is a gem. The tasting menu is a unique experience. The chef is the only employee,  he does everything on his own while chatting with the guests. His passion for cooking is inspiring. Most importantly, the food and wine are absolutely delicious."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"It is a highly recommended restaurant. Quiet and cozy space. We ordered the tasting menu. A good presentation, the dishes very elaborate and everything super good. Vidal is useful for everything, he is a versatile and charming person, thanks for everything."
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Nice space, quiet and relaxing to enjoy. Very good, and sometimes brilliant, combinations of flavors. No surprise about the quality, in fact a bit deceived considering the comments, but still very good standard. Service committed, well explained but a bit weird understandable as it is driven by only one person. Good experience to have but, in our opinion, not to repeat, as for the bill, there are many options in the city that are worth it a try."
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,Fantastic tasting menu with a good pairing of wines with very good product and service. All done and served for a crack!
Restaurant La Forquilla,Perfect food. It is incredible that this is possible by one person and for this price. We loved our evening here. Big big recommedation! Food
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Surprising discovery. You can see mastery and know-how in their preparations. The most surprising thing is that the chef takes care of everything, and when I say everything, it is everything. What good taste in the presentations and flavors, with a very good product and know-how. Simple and comfortable place. It is one of the places to repeat because you leave with a very good taste in your mouth and having eaten phenomenally. He certainly has the makings of a super chef. Congratulations and continue having fun."
Restaurant La Forquilla,Most amazing place in Barcelona! Chef Vidal is a master in the kitchen!  If you are in Barcelona you need to go here! Recommended dishes
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Excellent!!!! Quality product, superb atmosphere and very friendly service.... There is nothing like it in Barcelona!!!"
Restaurant La Forquilla,Loved it!
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,Stunning experience
Restaurant La Forquilla,"A fantastic tasting menu experience last night. You absolutely MUST go. This guy is a one in a million. Go now before he gets his Michelin stars! Cant see where to post photos but trust me, hes brilliant"
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,Good atmosphere and food. They have a menu for  65 that is very good. The chef is also the one who serves you and makes the experience even more personal. Highly recommended :)
Restaurant La Forquilla,
Restaurant La Forquilla,Cozy place ran by owner chef - fantastic food ! I left full and contented. I hope he gets more business :) thank you for the food Also for reviews that say he is rude   I beg to differ. Owner is really nice and can see he is just an honest guy. Let s help real passionate cooks thrive
Restaurant La Forquilla,We enjoyed a spectacular lunch. We were recommended and how lucky that they discovered it for us! Congratulations on the project!!!
Restaurant La Forquilla,"Restaurant run by a young chef, with experience because it was previously on Carrer PereIV with the same name, modern kitchen very well maintained and service at the owners expense, varied selection of wines at very reasonable prices."
VIRENS,Had quick lunch here- quick service with set menu.  Good is gorgeous!
VIRENS,
VIRENS,
VIRENS,Pleasant restaurant with sober and elegant decoration. Very professional and friendly service. Cook one surprise after another. Exceptional and imaginative. A surprise of continuous flavors and textures. Very original presentations. Various tasting and a la carte menus.

VIRENS,
VIRENS,A wonderful experience in a great atmosphere. I tried the tasting menu Tierra y Mar that was amazing. Never experienced such similar.
VIRENS,Restaurant located next to Maison Balto The food is good there. Not suitable for children
VIRENS,"Exquisite, fusion of vegetarian flavors and also for non-vegetarians. Fusion and creation of unique sensations, with the Chefs creativity you discover a new world of palate. Quiet, comfortable environment to enjoy and relax!"
VIRENS,"Simply one of the best restaurant weve ever been, exciting and unique food!"
VIRENS,Wonderful!
VIRENS,The service was a disaster in capital letters... And the food was very expensive for what it is. We will not return for sure!!!
VIRENS,"Its not worth what its worth even remotely. I would not go back. For being inside a 5 star GL hotel, the service was not up to par at all. They left plates on the table without picking them up, 5 different waiters came (there was no continuity in the experience). As for food, in my opinion, they overuse beets. We made the menu longer and they still wanted to charge us for the matcha tea bread. The carrot risotto tasted like orange (we communicated this) and they said they would send it to the kitchen because it shouldnt be like that but they didnt offer us any alternative. One of the 15 dishes on the menu was a cheese board, literally a dish that they use as filler to justify what its worth because it didnt make any kind of sense. Extremely strong cheeses without any type of accompaniment (toasts for example)."
VIRENS,Thank you for an amazing dinner. Love the creativity of the dishes   and a perfect balance of flavor and texture. Vegetarian options: Plenty of tasty vegetarian options!
VIRENS,
VIRENS,The best restaurant in Barcelona
VIRENS,"We had the gastrobotanical menu and absolutely loved it. Very original, great presentation and very friendly, attentive staff. Stylish ambience. Overall, a very successful evening. And we will definitely come back next time we are in Barcelona."
VIRENS,"Best vegan 6 course meal I ve had so far. The chef outdid himself The price point I put is for Christmas dinner menu which I think was fair,otherwise there are other options which are cheaper and well portioned Vegetarian options: We had a complete vegetarian 6 course menu, the chef outdid himself"
VIRENS,"A good experience at all times. The place is quiet and with a space between tables that is to be appreciated. The decoration is modern and simple, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The treatment of the staff is attentive at all times but not intrusive. I have to say that I am not a veggie person but I did enjoy the menu. We opted for the day menu and they made it easy for us to share dishes between us. This made it easy to taste several dishes. For starters, the gnocchi with crispy schnitzels are highly recommended. In the second rice and risotto. We opted for red prawn rice from Palamos. Really very good and tasty but the carrot risotto with crispy seaweed was quite an experience to repeat. Just as the rice is strong in taste, the rissoto is soft and very pleasant to the stomach. The desserts also highlight the fruit macedonia with hibiscus and seva and celery ice cream. Very digestible and pleasant to the taste. To accompany it, we tasted the green tea bread with spinach, aove and butter made by them. A good bread In short, despite having dishes with fish and meat, my personal recommendation is to opt for vegetables. I hope to return."
VIRENS,"An excellent experience!! Everything was fantastic from the first moment to the last, the food was exquisite, the place very nice and the staff wonderful. Aitor gave us a 10. I highly recommend it and we will 100% return!"
VIRENS,"Fascinating! The presentation, the exquisiteness of the flavors and above all the attention of all the staff. To highlight the attention of Aitor, a young dark-skinned boy, with great gastronomic knowledge and who helped us a lot in choosing the wines. We will repeat for sure! A real pleasure,"
VIRENS,
VIRENS,Oh my! 11 of 10!!!!! So great service!!! Food is AMAZING             We are very happy to find this jem   vegan food is beyond expectations
VIRENS,"A unique gastronomic experience. We ate a 12 course menu. All plant-based which was incredible, a unique combination of flavors. The attention of Miriam and Priscila made the dinner unique, they explained each dish to us and made sure we didnt miss anything. I will return without a doubt"
VIRENS,"They did not want to feed us, when we had a reservation confirmed by them for 01/01/24, at 3:00 p.m., claiming that the kitchen closes at that time So why do they set the time at 3:00 p.m. if its the kitchen closing? Fill out the complaint form for the Generalitat Very rude, unpleasant situation, we did not eat and they practically asked us to leave Incredible!! I have never had a situation like this Nothing, nothing recommended"
VIRENS,"Excellent food. Very improvable service. We went about a month ago, two of us, during the week and with the room practically empty. Dishes from the tasting menu arrived before we finished the previous one, on a couple of occasions they served us the dish before the cutlery, depending on the waiter who served you, they didnt even explain to us what we were going to drink, plus a pairing that added little or nothing to the experience. menu, with an extremely cheap selection for the price that included the pairing of approximately 50 euros extra to the menu. A great shame these conditions for an exquisitely designed menu. Vegetarian options: Many both vegetarian and vegan Dietary restrictions: Almost any of the possible restrictions are contemplated Wheelchair accessibility: At street level"
VIRENS,"We had a reservation on New Years at 3:00 p.m. and we arrived at 3:10 p.m. To our surprise, when the person in charge of the room arrives, he tells us that the kitchen is already closed and we cannot eat there. He then offers us to take a plate with the small mouth to the bar. Treatment could be very improved, the truth is a very bad experience to start the year and it is a Michelin star, in which better service is expected."
VIRENS,"Virens secures a middling 3/5 stars due to its commendable but not outstanding culinary offerings. The flavors are satisfying, and the ambiance is pleasing, contributing to a generally enjoyable lunch experience. However, the restaurant falters in the value department the relatively high prices dont quite match the portion sizes and quality, creating a noticeable disparity. While Virens certainly has its merits, the pricing structure and a need for more culinary finesse keep it from achieving a higher rating. Consider it for a decent meal, but be prepared for a slightly heavier dent in your wallet than anticipated."
VIRENS,"Nice atmosphere, but the food was overpriced and didn t impress. The service was also dreadfully slow."
VIRENS,
VIRENS,"I have celebrated a Christmas meeting with some colleagues that was very balanced in Treatment, Cooking, quality of the product. Congratulations to the team for their patience also in the thousand photos we took. If you want to eat healthy, your digestion will thank you. I will repeat on another occasion with family and friends. Congratulations guys and happy holidays"
VIRENS,"Very upscale and sophisticated restaurant.  Although, in general,  I dont like vegan stuff,  I was very pleasantly surprised with this place. Dont get me wrong,  they do have meat and fish dishes,  but they are very heavy on the vegan recipes, and I have to admit,  they perfected them! Very nice ambiance and excellent service."
VIRENS,"I saw the article in Foodie Culture magazine, and it met expectations 100%. Excellent food and very good treatment. (Photos of some of the dishes)"
VIRENS,
VIRENS,"Impeccable! What this guys do with vegetables is absolutely amazing: you have such an explosion of different tastes, aromas, structures. Beautiful servings and love the Chef has for what he is doing in every dish"
VIRENS,Vegetarian options: Heerlijke vegetarische gerechten! Food
VIRENS,"I went to eat and we found a hair in the food. With the prices they charge for the dishes, it is not worth it in terms of quality-price and the variety of the menu leaves a lot to be desired."
VIRENS,Restaurant located in a hotel in the center of Barcelona. with a 5-star GL rating. Exquisite atmosphere and attentive service. Cuisine mostly made with seasonal vegetables with the option of fish and meat. 3 Tasting and a la carte menus. Seasonal products of excellent quality prepared in a careful and original way. A must visit if you like good food and especially vegetarian and original food. Vegetarian options: Very varied cuisine with seasonal vegetables
VIRENS,"They welcomed us with a complimentary cocktail, it was very good. We tried the green menu, the dishes were very delicious, but I needed a sweeter dessert. I loved the matcha bread. The wine we chose was perfect to accompany dinner. Overall the experience was pleasant and delicious. Highly recommended!"
VIRENS,"Bad experience that ruined the food. Reserve by asking the favor so that with the dessert it is with a candle since it was my partners birthday. I called them again an hour before to remind them about the candles and they said they would do it. Well, during the meal the waiters were in a hurry to remove our plates, at no time asking if we were enjoying it, etc. Furthermore, the explanations of the dishes are very concise. Oh, and if that werent enough, at the end I was waiting for them to bring out at least one candle or some detail and nothing... I had no choice but to ask for the bill and leave the restaurant. Very disappointed"
VIRENS,"Good afternoon! Last Sunday the 19th we celebrated a family lunch at his restaurant. All very well, except for two waitresses who served us the whole time in English. A real shame and lack of respect towards the people of the country Or....Catalonia. Cordially"
VIRENS,"Great food, nice place, nice atmosphere. A big mistake... there are waiters who only speak English, neither Catalan nor Spanish. You feel out of place"
VIRENS,Very high level vegetarian food
VIRENS,"Excellent food and interesting dishes, we ate the sea and mountain tasting menu and it was amazing how they treat seasonal products. However, the service and attention to detail fell short of the food and impacted the overall feel. No allergies or special request made in the reservation were received, a shame because the food is well worth it, a 10 for the chef and his team."
VIRENS,"If you like fine dining but dont want to go into debt, you should definitely visit the Virens restaurant in the 5* Hotel Almanach at lunchtime. Chef Rodrigo de la Calle is completely committed to using regional ingredients and has a vegetarian focus - without sacrificing meat, fish and seafood lovers. We chose the lunch menu with a starter, main course and a dessert. For just under 45 euros you not only get a decent meal, you also get water and coffee. The food was formidable and, like the extremely friendly and competent service, did not invite any criticism."
VIRENS,"Many vegetarian options, all very delicious, recommended."
VIRENS,Delicious and very pretty
VIRENS,"Wonderful evening, delicious! Vegetarian options: Just delicious Food : 5/5 |"
VIRENS,"A very nice restaurant, excellent food and good service."
VIRENS,
VIRENS,Its not open 24 hours a day
VIRENS,
VIRENS,"Incredible experience in all aspects that can be enjoyed: - Land-sea tasting menu: exquisite flavors and very well done. I recommend adding the green tea bread which is not included and is delicious. - attention: Ivan has been charming!! He explains everything and also knows how to recommend wines for each dish very well. Without a doubt he gets 10/10 for the place since his attention has given the special touch to our visit to Virens. Thank you Ivan and the entire team! Everyone is excellent and very kind! - Super comfortable atmosphere, quiet music, cozy. We chose a table with a sofa and I really recommend it. The time between courses is perfect. Between the attention received, the comfort and the place in general, when we saw the time more than 2.5 hours had passed without realizing it, we were very comfortable! In short: everything excellent! I recommend it 100% and I will definitely return. Its not cheap, but you leave there with that feeling that it was worth every euro spent!!"
VIRENS,"The restaurant is one of the best I have ever eaten at. Chef Rodrigos creativity is incredible! How with ingredients as simple as lettuce you can make such incredible dishes! The prices are very reasonable, even cheap for the 5-star level of the dishes. We went at noon and we will return. Very friendly and warm attention. Congratulations!!"
VIRENS,
VIRENS,"We went to a lot of places in Barcelona but this was by far the best meal we had. Try any of the tasting menus - its so creative, flavorful and just great service. Thank you for a great time!"
VIRENS,"Yesterday was my second time at Virens, and I was excited to go back because I loved it the first time. However, yesterday my expectations were a little disappointed, as the food failed to surprise me as much, which was a shame The carrot rice was delicious, but the starters were neither good nor bad... they were ok. The service was excellent, especially a very friendly lady who was always smiling and professional. We were also served by a younger and nicer girl. My only complaint would be that we mentioned that one person didnt eat beets, and they still served us beets... That was a small slip, but overall it was good."
VIRENS,Specialized in vegetables. All very original and very well served.
VIRENS,
VIRENS,
VIRENS,
VIRENS,To repeat with the option of vegetarian dishes!
VIRENS,"A friend recommended it to us and we got it right, the well-prepared dishes with a great variety of flavors and textures. Excellent veggie options and with possibility for those who are not. Very good room service. Vegetarian options: Variety of dishes."
VIRENS,"Such a beautiful meal. We got the gastrobotanica tasting menu and it was an experience to remember. The pickled radish was insane - a radish? So tasty????? But the risotto will live on in my heart; it was very special. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent food and service, but especially for vegetarians like me who love fine dining but struggle with non-meat options. Absolute highlight of our Barcelona trip."
VIRENS,"We were there recently, and we were very surprised, everything was very delicious. We had the Green Experience tasting menu, very complete, the dishes were very well presented, you start by eating with your eyes. The service was a 10, very attentive, friendly, we felt at home, thank you very much Virens team, (kitchen and living room) and thank you very much Antonela! Vegetarian options: Vegetable dishes are incredibly delicious."
VIRENS,"I have had the most extensive tasting menu and each dish has dazzled me. I discovered Rodrigo de la Calles cuisine at El Invernadero in Madrid and here he confirmed that he is one of the best chefs in this country. It is true that the service may lack knowledge of some of the ingredients or processes of the dishes it presents, but it is compensated by its effort to resolve doubts and its friendliness. Im looking forward to returning. MAGNIFICENT!"
VIRENS,Finally a place that can creatively incorporate vegetables into a meal
VIRENS,"Although we dont usually like restaurants inside hotels, Virens is worth making an exception. We loved all the dishes and we were very comfortable. They have a menu with about 3 or 4 dishes to choose from or, in the evenings, the possibility of a la carte. The service was very good, they clarified any questions about the dishes and were friendly and kind. They have a wine list by the bottle or by the glass. Highly recommended. Wheelchair accessibility: It is located on the ground floor with access from the hotel or directly from the street."
VIRENS,Amazing food - just beautiful!
VIRENS,Ce restaurant est tout a fait exquis ! Cest etonnant tout ce quon peut faire avec des legumes. Jai particulierement apprecie de decouvrir de nouvelles saveurs et de nouvelles associations de gouts. Jai eu une preference pour le risotto a lartichaut. Le service est excellent et nous avons ete tres bien conseilles par notre serveuse. Merci !
VIRENS,"Good food but too slow service. Misleading midday menu because it is supposed to be  32, but in reality 90% of the time it will be  40 ( 8 supplement on almost all main dishes). There is a lack of agility and synthesis of the explanations of the dishes. Modern place but a little cold. Good and different food!"
VIRENS,"Went here for a date night and it was stellar. Lots of nice vegetarian options that were all delicious and beautifully presented. Portions were a bit on the small side, but allows you to try more things! The risotto is INCREDIBLE. One of the best we ve ever had. Very interesting desserts as well - we had the red onion & celery gelato which was unexpectedly delightful. The space is gorgeous, really charming and elegant. Service was solid. Happy to have tried it!"
VIRENS,
VIRENS,"Attached to the Almanac Hotel, Virens offers a lunch menu for  32 that includes a starter, main, dessert, water and a coffee or tea. The menu focuses on vegetarian dishes with meat options available for an additional fee. The vegetarian options showcase the chef s appreciation for natural ingredients - fresh and flavorful for instance the morel mushrooms with green asparagus with a slight crunch and the artichoke risotto with crispy artichoke on top. The highlight of the meal was the pumpkin based crema catalana  with chocolate and edible flowers and the green tea bread infused with olive oil and sea salt. Only disappointment was the price of the green tea bread ( 12 for two bread rolls) and that only a small bottle of water was included in the menu. The restaurant itself is located in a very stylish setting with large windows offering a view of Gran Via and welcoming the daylight. Would recommend checking out especially for those who love plant-based food options."
VIRENS,"Beautiful restaurant inside a hotel. We went for lunch and had a good experience - my friend is vegetarian and there were many options for her. We opted for only vegetarian dishes, and even as a non vegetarian I enjoyed them and felt satisfied. Our favorite was the spinach and kale croquetas. The asparagus was also very tasty. The carrots were ok but didn t stand out as much as the other dishes. The desserts were a bit too much out of the box for us so we opted out. The space is beautiful, with comfortable chairs, and the service was good. Vegetarian options: Many vegetarian options - our favorite was the spinach and kale croquetas."

VIRENS,"We did the lunch menu and more than correct! Enter a first course, a second course, dessert, water and coffee for  32. I dont give 5 stars because there were 6 seconds to choose from, but 5 of them with a supplement of  8... Both the food and the preparations are worthy of a chef with a Michelin star. The service at all times very correct and pleasant. Well be coming back!"
VIRENS,"Excellent diner,  tres bon conseils des vins, on recommande fortement"
VIRENS,"@virensbarcelona with a single motto, healthy food. We tried one of their tasting menus, which reflect their cuisine. . Menu  55 - Pickled turnip with spices - Beetroot tartare - Cold carrot soup - Pepper salad - Salted tatin with caramelized leeks - Egg at low temperature - Artichoke rice - Fruit macedonia with onion and celery ice cream. - Green bread with butter  6 -  Biodiverso Orange  34 4 Good service. Healthy food restaurant Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 619, Barcelona . #gastrocatalunya #virens #barcelona #catalonia #mediterranean"
VIRENS,"The assessment is based on the excessive price of the restaurants dishes which result in around  50/person without wines or desserts. As examples:  4/croquette;  25-30 per main course. On the positive side, the service is cordial and some of the dishes are originally daring (comlenillas in the wok). To improve, apart from the price, I would recommend changing the atmosphere (cold decoration, decontextualized electronic music) and also offering lighter main courses."
VIRENS,"The Virens restaurant stands out for the excellence of its dishes. Excellent quality-price ratio and I would also highlight the service (exceptional, out of 10). Very elaborate and original food, without being excessively modern."
VIRENS,Amazing food
VIRENS,Une omelette baveuse en style de tortillas espagnole sans patates. Et du jambon iberique tres gras....avec 2 verres de rose pour 70 ....
VIRENS,We liked it. Prepared food and careful presentation. We would have appreciated larger quantities on the plate. They have natural wines.
VIRENS,"Excellent concept based on seasonal vegetables and very good dishes, but as a restaurant it has obvious weak points. The staff is weak in the welcome and in the presentation of the dishes and in the treatment. We ordered the pairing with the menu: basically wines and nothing surprising or memorable. The artisan cheeses option on the menu is ridiculous in presentation and selection of the product. Clearly it is not worth the total of what it offers as an experience and it gives the impression of being aimed at an audience that is not the local one."
VIRENS,"Yesterday we had dinner at Virens, the restaurant located inside the Almanac Hotel. The restaurant   looks business elegant, with dark marble tables and big window walls looking towards the street. The maitre welcomed us epxplaining the menu and we dediced to try the degustation menu called Gastrobotanica (55 euros - 6 dishes). The cuisine level is high, with elebarated dishes and armonic flavours. The chef has the ability to enhance vegetables as protagonists of the dishes, by capturing unique unexperienced flavors from even carrots and leek.  In particular, we most appreciated the pepper tartare,  risotto with artichokes and leek sable. We were sorry that the service didnt reflect the cuisine level, as we experienced a couple of unwelocoming episodes. In particular, as the wine and first dish arrived, we had to ask for water for the second time, which still didnt arrive (while in restaurants at that level, you shouldnt even have to ask for water). Also, we had to ask for bread for two times, and it arrived at the end of the experience, which was really frustrating, as we thought the maitre would ask us if we wanted bread, instead we had to ask for two times and wait for one hour for it to arrive. Also, we had to make active efforts to establish a connection with the maitre or the woman who served us. In the overall, the food was worth the price, the service wasn`t."
VIRENS,Very average food for such a price. Good staff and service.

VIRENS,
VIRENS,Rodrigos good work is impressive. Very elaborate and excellent dishes.
VIRENS,"Healthy but incredibly delicious food, explosion of flavours and a great service from all the staff. The avocado was something Ive never experienced before and it was delighting. The pumpkin creme brule is also a must."
VIRENS,"A fantastic experience and a chance to taste locally sourced food constructed in totally unexpected dishes. Service was exemplary and the Manager,  Aitor, was, as usual, a charming host. A return visit will be done. Vegetarian options: Whatever you dietetary tastes, then you will find options. Dietary restrictions: Whatever you dietetary tastes, then you will find options"
VIRENS,Exceptional
VIRENS,"Everything was excellent: from the bread with smoked butter, the starter, main course, and dessert, everything is simply delicious. The food is prepared in a very sophisticated way, just right, surprising, full of flavors, great quality of ingredients. Without forgetting the presentation of the dishes and the atmosphere is very chic. Great job by the chefs to bring out the best flavors of any ingredient. Vegetarian options: There are many vegetarian food options among starters, mains and desserts."
VIRENS,Great place for dinner with very friendly and smiley staff. Very nice restaurant with good food. The staff was also very nice and welcoming.
VIRENS,"The restaurant ambience and the food/dinner are fantastic! I was there last night, April 27, with my 2 best friends and the service offered by the restaurant manager, Aitor, and the waitress, Miriam, were  second to none. Absolutely FANTASTIC! Really recommend it!"
VIRENS,"Amazing! We went today, we are into seafood and we were pleasantly surprised. Everything was very delicious, we ordered several starters to share, recommendations from the waiter, and then a second each added together. I ordered the artichoke risotto with broccoli crest and it was spectacular. Two ordered the monkfish and said it was very good and two others ordered the red shrimp rice and it was fantastic. Then the desserts arrived and the surprise was even greater. The pumpkin cream was very good, and three of us shared the rice with coconut milk and red fruits, very delicious. And the celery and onion, I dont remember the name of the dessert, was fantastic. Incredible, we are still wondering where the onion and celery were. The service was very good, the Colombian waiter was very nice and had good recommendations. Of course to repeat."
VIRENS,Good dinner
Tope,
Tope,I loved the experience at the top restaurant. The attention of Mirko and Denis has been unbeatable. We have enjoyed the best views mixing some very fresh cocktails on this impeccable terrace we will return
Tope,
Tope,"I was specifically coming to this roof top to watch a sunset, but only when I came the told me that it s closed. On google maps it s written that it s open, as well as on their official pages. Disappointed"
Tope,
Tope,"A spectacular place, it was highly recommended on social networks and we went to see if everything we read was true and it is worth it, the only thing I would change is the position of the speakers, the place where we were there couldnt be talked about how loud it was. You could hear the music, the attention of the luxury waiters like the place, the finger-licking tacos, and the delicious drinks. A place to go in good company, I recommend it at   x  , we will return for sure."
Tope,
Tope,Good place to watch the sunset with a good drink
Tope,"The place is above the hotel on the terrace. It is very modern, ideal for having a drink after work. They close early at 10pm. The views are very beautiful."
Tope,"The cool terrace! The Mexican style food is also good, and the service exquisite. We went with a dog and they made everything very easy for us!"
Tope,"Spectacular terrace, very good food. In good company its great"
Tope,
Tope,"High prices. Good views. Bad service. Bad food. There was a person in the kitchen, cooking meat on a griddle and taking the product with his hands and putting it on plates (directly without tongs or gloves) this same person then went out to throw out the garbage. They serve coffees without changing the coffee load (they serve several coffees with the same load). Friendliness of the staff (especially PR) 0. Not recommended at all. There are dozens of rooftops with better views and better services in Barcelona."
Tope,"It is a beautiful terrace, the cocktails are very delicious and the food is delicious! The attention of the staff that welcomes you and takes care of the location is very personal and efficient; also the waiters. The manager Felix Toro was super friendly, very nice, he made everything easy... To have a good time and repeat!!!!"
Tope,"Excellent views, good service and as a negative point the music and atmosphere."
Tope,
Tope,"Spectacular views, modern, pleasant"
Tope,
Tope,"It was amazing. First of all, you are in Spain. Sit back and enjoy. What an experience!!"
Tope,"Good place, but this year it has gotten worse, the area facing the Sagrada Familia is never usually available, the waiters are overwhelmed and are no longer as friendly as before."
Tope,"Located on the 10th floor of the Hoxson hotel. A place with beautiful views. First class attention, they were very friendly. The food is Mexican style, delicious but I didnt think it was a big deal. The dispenser drinks, which I dont like very much for what they cost. We ordered a pisco sour to try but no, they didnt prepare it correctly. The egg flavor was very noticeable and it seems that I had not added the rubber syrup. In conclusion, it was Ok."
Tope,
Tope,"Nice bar that advertises a view of the Sagrada Familia, unfortunately from there you can only see the tower opposite. But the atmosphere there was nice."
Tope,
Tope,"Thursday, 11:30 p.m., you dont feel welcome at all from the staff, quite the opposite... they want to kick you out early as if in a rush to close when theyre supposed to close at 1... bad cocktails, well the only good thing? The views. But you can find views in a thousand places much better than this one."
Tope,
Tope,"Spectacular views from the terrace, ideal for having a cocktail and enjoying the DJ. with your partner or friends. Super nice atmosphere and good treatment."
Tope,"Spectacular. With music and a pleasant atmosphere. The only thing, they serve you wine in a plastic glass. That cant be seen please"
Tope,"Food was underwhelming and expensive for what it was. Chicken tacos were so plain and the chicken was a bit too dry. Cocktails were disappointing. Service was slow, but not chill vibe easy pace slow, just slow slow. The staff were really friendly and actually very nice people it s just all the above doesn t warrant the cost and hype. As a guest staying at the hotel it s unfortunate as the view is stunning, but something easy like a glass of wine or a beer is a better choice for socialising here. Will most likely have drinks in the bar downstairs next time."
Tope,"A stunning view 360 to see the city and sagrada familia. We love the cocktails and the atmosphere there, somehow its crowded but mostly we can find the table without booking in advance for 2 people. The price is pretty reasonable to compare to other sky bars in city."
Tope,Great rooftop bar in The Hoxton hotel. Fantastic views of the city. My friend and I shared some great tapas and Cava. A little gem
Tope,
Tope,
Tope,"We mainly came for the view of the Sagrada Familia, but unfortunately the side with the view is packed and the table in that corner is reserved (i.e. it would be rude to walk into their space and start snapping pictures). Restaurants/bars with killer views tend to have underwhelming food because people will come no matter what, and this place is no exception. The food is overpriced and is badly pretending to be elevated cuisine. Id say its a nice environment to come for just a drink, but surprisingly the cocktails are horrendous: no better than juice poorly balanced with liquor. At least the service is good."
Tope,"Fantastic view, high priced food, luxurious location Vegetarian options: Yes, there is an option Kid-friendliness: There is no option for children Wheelchair accessibility: Wheelchair access"
Tope,Great place to have a drink with a great view on Sagrada Familia. Prices are according to place and view.
Tope,
Tope,Excellent treatment from Adam.
Tope,"The terrace is spectacular, beautiful views. The best of all the service, ADAM is wonderful and treated us spectacularly."
Tope,Nice plac to have an after work drink
Tope,"First experience was great but not like the second : I called several times to order a place for me and 10 people for my birth day . On the first try they hung off the phone . After several times I successfully talked to someone who heard Im speaking english and hung off the phone again ( only when I was trying to speak in spanish after another try she talked to me ) . Not something I expected from a place who is welcoming tourists and customers all around the world . After some more several times I talked to the same woman who told me to wait F I V E MINUTES on the line !!! I heard while I was waiting how she is giving customers service  and hung off the phone again !!! I managed to order a place , after all this - they made a mistake in the order and I couldnt even catch anyone to fix it . For two days no one answered . I was so disappointed after the first experience in the terrace : good food , nice view . But service - not as it was after the first time I was dining there . Not something Im expecting from a restaurant who is giving service to people all around the world and also giving hotel services for tourists ..."
Tope,
Tope,"Regrettable experience. Waiting 15 minutes for a waiter to serve you and for him to show up just finishing chewing, unprofessional. Afterwards they serve you a gin and tonic in which they put the tonic of their choice and the amount of gin as they want (the bottle runs out halfway through refilling the jigger and leaves the glass like that). Meanwhile a lot of waiters talking without attending to customers. Never to return"
Tope,"The Mexican menu was delicious, the service spectacular and the atmosphere wonderful."
Tope,Music and an unparalleled view
Tope,"Amazing city views including Sagrada Familia. Great service, delicious cocktails. Be sure to reserve a table to avoid disappointment."
Tope,"The views are beautiful, good music and the service was great, the girls very nice and approachable. One downside to the cocktails, it is pure ice and a small glass in relation to price-quality."
Tope,
Tope,"The best thing is the view, the food is delicious but there are better Mexican restaurants in Barcelona. The service is somewhat slow."
Tope,
Tope,"Views are 5 Everything else, food, cocktails, it is very bad. A beer is 7.5 ?!?! Worst mojitos ever"
Tope,
Tope,"Great spot for cocktails, tacos and amazing views. Joaquin and Daniel took great care of us and mix a mean margarita. Highly recommend"
Tope,"We went to snack on some nachos with guacamole and some tacos, the space was very nice near the pool and with the Glorias tower illuminated behind, but they didnt even give us a napkin, we had to ask several times, for the prices they have for the drinks they put them in plastic cups. I did not like. Im sorry."
Tope,Awesome views of Barcelona
Tope,
Tope,"To have a drink or a bite to eat its great, good views, DJ. Both for a date and to meet friends."
Tope,"Excellent place, we fulfilled the objective of sharing with friends and having a good time,,We were very well attended,.By Joaquin,,, Excellent person and attentive at all times Very bad service from the Italian girl. negligence and bad character, when serving, otherwise it is an excellent place"
Tope,"Great view, felt fancy but chill vibes! We were served by Sabrina and she was really sweet, made our evening smoother"
Tope,
Tope,Place for tourists where they serve you everything and even wine in plastic glasses. Regular care. The normal food.
Tope,"The atmosphere of the place is super patchy, excellent for spending the afternoon, eating tacos and having some cocktails with an enviable view."
Tope,"Tope is the Rooftop of Hotel Hoxton del Poblenou. This terrace is ideal for going to have a drink in a group and offers spectacular views of Barcelona. It is divided into 3 areas, 2 which are dedicated to Tope customers and 1 which is where the pool is, which is the area reserved for Hotel customers."
Tope,
Tope,
Tope,
Tope,"The place   the excellent service migue an excellent person a unique treatment, few restaurants have a service like yours do not change I will return"
Tope,Vue incroyable !
Tope,
Tope,Slow and unresolved service. We had to ask for the things we wanted more than once. I didnt like at all that despite being a  top  terrace they serve you everything in plastic cups. Cool atmosphere.
Tope,The food and service were very bad and the cocktails were not well presented. It was my first and last day that I will go to TOPE. I didnt like it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.
Tope,"It is a place with the possibility of enjoying the sunset in the heart of Barcelona with the option to snack on something and have a drink with a variety of cocktails, throw away the typical Skyline posture with live music which if you are looking to enjoy in that environment it is ideal, with beautiful views and with a small pool that does its job. Wheelchair accessibility: It is accessible with fair but sufficient hallways and elevators"
Tope,"The terrace itself is good, good views and atmosphere. We ordered two glasses of wine and it was a disappointment considering the type of terrace and hotel it is. The glasses are plastic, scratched on all sides and came very dirty. My glass even still had the lipstick of the person I drank from earlier. That means that they neither clean them nor check if they are clean before serving customers, very bad. Even in the seediest bar in Barcelona they give you clean crystal glasses. Furthermore, the quality of the wines leaves much to be desired, especially considering the prices. If we return it will be to order bottled beer, I dont trust anything else on this terrace."
Tope,
Tope,"I have been to this terrace several times already and yet I dont think I will return again unless it is to order a beer. The last time I was there, they brought us the wine in two dirty plastic glasses with drops of water still on them from having rinsed the glasses, because they were still dirty, to the point that you could see the lipstick mark of the previous person who had used them. Being a terrace of a 4-star hotel, I think they should take a little more care of their image and for simple hygiene, put clean things. Although the terrace is very cool and I want to be there, the fact that they are not careful with things as basic as this makes me want not to return."
Tope,Great place
Tope,"Hotel in the center of Barcelona, very well located, incredible views from the rooftop, in the lobby you can have delicious cocktails made by Juan, the service is excellent, live music, highly recommended."

Tope,"The hygiene left a lot to be desired, all the dirty glasses were poorly washed and I saw with my own eyes how the waiter only gave the glasses a little water"
Tope,Everything is incredible!!!
Tope,
Tope,"I loved the place, it is very cozy, good music, food and not to mention the drinks, it has a great view"
Tope,"Spectacular views and extraordinary waiters, especially Valentine"
Tope,"Excellent terrace and your waiter Valentin, a genius in attention. The DJ that @raulnaro played for us is exquisite A score of 10"
Tope,Good
Tope,Excellent place to have a drink in a privileged setting and a young atmosphere.
Tope,"The best rooftop in Bcn! Excellent food and very good service from the entire team, especially from Felix Toro the PR who makes you feel at home. I recommend 100%"
Tope,Excellent place in Barcelona to share some beers with a panoramic view of the city!!! There are a variety of drinks and food options. It is recommended to make a reservation in advance to take advantage of a place with a good view!!

Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"The best place to eat chicken and waffles American style , top food and friendly people."

There was some confusion as to what drinks are included but eventually I got a Sangria to my request and otherwise we just drank mimosas. Food (we got the sampler) was great and drinks were refilled during our stay. Music (playlist) was great and staff very friendly. Great place to just hang out and plan the day, would recommend"

Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,One of the best places in Barcelona! Bottomless mimosas were so great!
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,I would give my life for Claudia Food
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"One of the girls was very rude when I asked what gluten-free options there were, she laughed and told me if I didnt realize it was an American food place that everything had gluten. He told me I should have asked before arriving. I definitely wont be coming back."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"I congratulate the cook, the breaded chicken and the cheesecake, spectacular. Excellent treatment from all staff. I will repeat for sure."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"We went to say goodbye to some friends, we were a large group of 18 people, they treated us all excellently!! I will definitely come back!"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Very bad place, the owner with an incredibly rude, arrogant, and angry Diva attitude. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE, they took a while with the food, they offered a menu on the website that had nothing to do with what they offered at the place. Dont even think about claiming anything because they will literally throw you out of the place. Horrible experience! Postscript: LIAR,   We have paid our full bill, what a quality response, it largely confirms my review. Never lie trying to minimize your bad attitude and rude treatment. Also, reading the many 1-star reviews that you have earned with little effort, you will notice the pattern, and it more than reinforces how terribly bad your restaurant is."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"I ve finally found where to have those comfort foods from when I lived in the USA. The great staff  Carl and Claudia  accommodate special requests and serve with a smile. I really enjoy ordering the Bottomless Mimosas.. imagine  all the mimosas you want to drink while having breakfast.. ie- eggs-Benedict, beacon and pancakes. The atmosphere is also amazing. On some days I go and enjoy a hot cup of tomato soup and accompany it with their delicious Fifth Avenue Club Sandwich. I highly recommend visiting them."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,I had the happiest birthday here   Jordan and Claudia were such amazing hosts   100% recommend!!!
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,This was great brunch experience. Service was amazing. The bottomless brunch actually was. Never had an empty glass. Was having such a good time didnt take photos.

Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Much more than a delicious brunch, dinners, cocktails, DJs.... I recommend it to you!"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,What a fun brunch spot with a fab  Cinde-f -rella  vibe (Pretty Woman). We went on a Sunday when there was a DJ (great tracks  ). I had the steak and eggs; steak cooked perfectly. My husband had been dying for some tasty waffles and we both opted for the bottomless sangria+mimosa. I also enjoyed their hot-toddy PERFECTION! We will be going back.
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,Excellent food and attention!
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,Everything is super delicious. Excellent attention. A very warm place that makes you want to stay.
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Cinderella is not a run-of-the-mill brunch option in Barcelona. I recently organized a weekend lunch for some 18 people with an entree, juice, dessert and coffee/tea included. My favorite entrees are the Southern Scrambled Eggs (with or without chorizo) and the Fried Chicken and Waffles. The service is impeccable and personalized. It is centrally located in the Eixample neighbourhood of Barcelona and has a lovely ambience which includes an area with sofas to hang out with friends for a cosier experience."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"An excellent experience delicious food, amiable, efficient staff, gracious host, comfortable, clean place!"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,A nice diner style restaurant in the heart of town. I ll be back with friends.
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,Very good and abundant American breakfast!
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Not sure why this place has 4,7 stars. The hamburger we got was raw, and the fried chicken was also not great. Maybe they are better for a drinking brunch experience. But if you need a good meal, just skip this."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,food was extremely delicious and super nice staff.
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Perfect to spend a good day, good food and service"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"We walked in by chance walking down the street and we loved it, the waiter was super friendly and the atmosphere was impeccable."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Excellent, DJ Rodis animation makes the space even more beautiful..."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"We dined in. Staff is really nice and friendly but professional. Food is 10/10, would recommend it."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Cute, nice and clean !"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Delightful New Years Eve celebration at Cinderella! The cocktails were a burst of flavor, and the fresh, fun dishes added a tasty twist to the festivities. A memorable experience with a perfect blend of ambiance and culinary delights. Highly recommend!"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Super tasty Great and pleasant service by wonderful Claudia. Very refreshing flavors that makes you want to come back, and for sure we ll do that Thank you Jordan for a great time."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"We had a lovely brunch here Benedict, tater tots, and fried chicken/waffles. Also the best mimosas I ve had in a while! Thanks to Jordan and Claudia for the great time"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Came for brunch with a friend and had a fantastic meal, looking forward to coming back. The staff was very friendly and attentive."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,Perfect spot for American style brunch! Bottomless mimosas and delicious food.
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,Excellent attention and very nice and delicious everything!
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Excellent American brunch spot. Lovely location in the Eixample neighborhood, charming decor, thoughtful and attentive service from staff. I had a late breakfast with Vivian s Omelette, and a matcha / juice combo (not sure the name, but ask owner Jordan about it!); everything was delish!"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Hello, we spent New Year s Eve @ Cinderella. We had a great time, very good food and fabulous cocktails. The atmosphere was lovely, super friendly staff, good music. We recommend the place most heartily."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"My wife and I dined here for brunch and it was fantastic. She had a delicious brunch of the day,  which was delicious.  Also, If you are looking for LEGIT Shakshuka in BCN, look no further.  So many places get it wrong. Jordan was so welcoming, and we had a fantastic visit with him.  Do not hesitate.  The food and experience was fantastic."
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,"Saw their American style brunch menu and we decided to give it a try.  I had the chicken and waffles while my husband sampled the All American breakfast.  The chicken was boneless and fried crispy with a hint if spice and fall apart tender.  Two crispy waffles with maple syrup completed the dish and were well excellent.  My husband s scrambled eggs with bacon came with either pancakes or waffles and he opted for the pancakes.  Eggs scrambled and not dry, bacon crispy but pancakes just a tad overcooked.  The highlight was the large cafe con leche which was heaven.  Jordan, the proud owner, said the decor and name Cinderella was a homage to Julia Roberts.  He s a big fan and admires her elegance and down to earth  personality.  It s a charming restaurant with a feel of home (US) plus the local joy of a life well lived.  We ll be back and bring our friends.  They have crab cakes!!!!"
Cinderella Cafe & Cocktails,Excellent service and food! Highly recommended!
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Very high level, attention and cuisine"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Although I am not a big fan of sea food, I was deeply impressed by the culinary mastery of the restaurants gastronomical team as well as the hospitality & warmth of all the service staff. As all the seafood were cooked in innovative ways that preserve their distinctive freshness while greatly enhancing their delicacy and removing unpleasant smell, their methods to deal with pigeon and green beans also greatly pleased my tastes. I was especially surprised by the pretty gifts the team prepared for me in my hotel room, as the cooking book with the message & signatures from the team really warmed my heart and the olive oil & bottle opener also become my beloved souvenirs. Anyway, would definitely recommend it to my friends who have the chance to visit the beautiful city of Barcelona!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"You expect more than a two star, Arroz de Paco tasting menu, on Sunday there is nothing more, monotonous abusing the truffle, even in the dessert. Highlight the very good and surprising pea cream. Dietary restrictions: Ask in the reservation Wheelchair accessibility: Adapted"
Enoteca Paco Perez,Excellent service
Enoteca Paco Perez,"If you want to get hungry and read letters in Spanish, this is your place."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"It is my second time at the Enoteca. The first one with the full tasting menu, this time the weekend rice menu. The dining room is welcoming, very well designed. Maybe the music was too loud (likely more and American style restaurant, in the traditional  Spanish restaurants we have less or no background music, it is a cultural thing). The personnel was welcoming and very polite. The lead waitress was very talented, knowledgeable and pleasant. The secondary waiters did a good job as well. The sommelier gave us a great recommendation regarding a Chardonnay  from the Penedes and a Tokaji after lunch. He gave us the right explanations but he did not overextend them, which felt perfect. The menu itself was 4 starters with small bites centered on sea products (cod, melva-anchovies, exquisite small smoked peas...). There is a bread tasting which was ok, but the starters and the rice were really the main characters. The rice was paella style for the non-Spanish readers. Rice with sea urchin, mushrooms. Most of the dishes had some black truffle. I am not a fan of truffle, but on this occasion I have to admit that it was fresh, it did not hide the other flavors and it was used wisely by the chef, great! Products were local and really fresh. The rice was wonderful with the soft sea urchin touch. The first desert was a brie cheese pastry and the second a sweet complex composition Winter-themed, difficult to describe, but with an excellent and refreshing taste. Petit fours were offered with coffee. My only complaint is that the coffee was clearly a capsule-coffee, the taste was clear and I was able to see the machine later. I think it was the only detail that did not match with this extraordinary restaurant. We had a great time, 200 euros per person all included, which might seem expensive but I think it is up to the level of the restaurant and according to other first tier restaurants in Barcelona. We will certainly return for a special occasion."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Amazing food!!!!!!!
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Unforgettable night with a special friend, the food was simply impressive and the service of the entire staff of 10, all super good, thank you very much for the experience."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Sensitive and balanced menu. right choice for a special sunday
Enoteca Paco Perez,"If you want the filling of HiEnd dinning this is the place, please ask Jennifer for wine experience overcoming Catalunya wines!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Une grande deception. Le fameux Paco Perez, chef deux etoiles... je mattendais a une fusion entre la cuisine moderne et la cuisine traditionnelle, mais surtout aux plat raffines, soigneusement travailles. Or, malgre la tres belle presentation, les plats manquaient de gout. Ils netaient pas trop savoureux, mais plutot fades. Cest vraiment dommage, parce que le diner netait pas donne meme si javais mange mieux ailleurs, dans plusieurs restaurants avec une etoile ou meme sans etoile. Pour detailler un peu, jai mange un menu degustation de fin dannee. - tartare de seiche et doursin - une entree interessante, meme si je ne suis pas tres fan doursin. - tartelette aux truffes - tres bonne et gouteuse. - Terrine de langoustine - fade, sans gout. Quelle deception pour moi qui adore langoustine... - Tartare de saint Jacques au caviar - le caviar a completement tue les saint Jacques. De plus, le plat netait pas vraiment travaille. Juste du saint Jacques decoupes avec du caviar dessus... - homard bleu - pas mal, mais peu gouteux. Je dirais - un ingredient noble qui na pas ete respecte... - bar - un poisson bien fait avec une belle texture, mais toujours il manquait du gout. - ravioles au bouillon - assez bon, mais toujours fade et avec peu de gout. - 2 desserts etaient la meilleure partie de la soiree, fort heureusement. Pour conclure, une soiree tres couteuse, mais peu gouteuse. Et ca cest vraiment dommage, parce que quand il y a du gout, on peut discuter sur les detailles. Mais la manque du gout et des saveurs et le plus grand pecher dans la cuisine."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Very special day, great service and great food in these luxurious restaurants, people should not be allowed to wear short-sleeved t-shirts."
Enoteca Paco Perez,The 9 course Christmas lunch was outstanding. Food was delicious and service was excellent.
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"If you have a website in Catalan, Catalan customers will be happier."
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Nice atmosphere (they could turn down the lights a bit).  Service was professional, but s-l-o-w.  Now to the food.  I would say a bit odd.  I was not a fan of the mixture of some of the flavors.  But here is the part that is unforgivable at any price point.  We got food poisoning and, given the timing, there is no doubt from where.  Mine was so bad that I could not even smell food for 24 hours, and 40 hours later, I m still queasy and my ribs hurt from heaving.  The other  unforgivable part (given the price point), is there was a fly buzzing around our table.  I ve never seen that in a Michelin 2 star you just can t have that when you re serving seafood and beef tartare.  Super disappointing."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Swing amazing dinner experience in this restaurant. With a new menu the dishes were just exceptional. Very very good! The only weird thing was that I got soemthing strange in my food and after I have mentioned it to the waiter it was forgotten and nothing happened afterwards. No apology no nothing. But it absolutely didn t ruin our experience.
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Not at all the two star Michelin quality that you would normally expect. The service was good, although waiting 10min before being guided to our table was unnecessary (anyone else than the manager could have done it). It also took us three attempts to get the air conditioning that was directly blowing on our heads down. We received the menus in French (although only one of us was French). Very long wait before you actually get some bread or appetizers. The food was disappointing! It was like putting as many ingredients in one plate was the goal (caviar from Poland in nearly every plate - not necessary!). The sauce of the wagyu beef should be left out! Keep it more simple! Complexity is not what brings the best taste   very expensive on top!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,High-end restaurant located in the beautiful Hotel Arts in Barcelona. Price about 250 euros per person and a tasting menu that revolves around the sea and its products (only one meat dish). Original and top quality dishes. Very good and very friendly staff. A great experience. Parking: You can use the hotel parking.
Enoteca Paco Perez,Yaiza and Yeime (I think thats how its spelled) were absolutely lovely with us We were very comfortable We are a family that likes to enjoy a dinner like this at least once a year The dinner was delicious and the desserts were delicious Special mention for the Petit Fours we had at the terrace. They were deliciousThank you
Enoteca Paco Perez,"We celebrated my birthday there - best gastronomic experience we ever had. Excellent mix of textures, temperatures and flavors. Especially we liked the sommelier, she was very knowledgeable and friendly - enhanced our experience to another level!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,Tremendous work or culinary art. Service was also incredible
Enoteca Paco Perez,"We ordered the tasting menu and it was a wonderful experience of flavors, colors and smells. The sea remembering Gaudi and the carabinero in his curry, I think they are the best dishes I have eaten in my life. And I also really liked the other dishes. I enjoyed all the food. Thanks to the chef and his entire team!! The only thing that bothered me was a table of about 6 people who were raising their voices until they became a real scandal. Maybe someone should have warned them that they were bothering them. Anyway, everything was so delicious, the service is so friendly and the place is so comfortable that that detail is more than forgiven"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Enoteca Paco Perez is a special occasion meal. Had the tasting menu with wine pairing and was quite satisfied. At this price point it should be competing among the best meals Ive ever had and while I cant say it quite got there, it was still quite good. Most dishes were hits (felt the scarlet shrimp and one or two of the desserts were good not great). The wine pairings also hit for the most part but again there were a few misses mixed in. The sherry really didnt feel like it was a nice wine and the dessert wine felt like it got worse as a combination rather than better. All of this is nitpicky though, experience and menu were great and while this doesnt quite compete with the best meals Ive ever had it was still an experience Im quite happy with."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Brilliant
Enoteca Paco Perez,"On the first day of our honeymoon trip to Barcelona, the gourmet feast at Enoteca Paco Perez became our first memory of Barcelona s food. It was perfect! Mushroom appetizers, risotto entrees and other meals can be eaten multiple times with various condiments on the plate to bring different tastes, which reflects the Michelin-starred chefs amazing skills."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Experience with the Sunday menu El arroz de Paco that unfortunately did not meet our previous expectations and even recognizing its meticulous preparation, we did not think it was on par with a two-Michelin-star cuisine, compared to the rest of the two-star restaurants. from the city. In our opinion, it would be preferable not to offer this special menu option at half the price of its usual menu, because from what we have been able to verify, it is detrimental to diners perception of its gastronomic proposal."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Michelin two-star restaurant, the food, service, and drinks are great. My friends and I are very happy raising children Kid-friendliness: There is a childrens menu specially provided for my 9-year-old, so there is no need to order expensive set menus."

Enoteca Paco Perez,One of the best fine dining establishments in Barcelona.. very unique flavours and amazing textures.. will be back for sure
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Impeccable restaurant, thank you to the great chef for letting us enjoy delicious dishes  cheers"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Ouf je n ai pas aime en general, surtout la nourriture. Ne vaut vraiment pas la peine. L ambiance aussi laisse a desirer ; aucune bougie sur les tables, de grosses plantes en pot au lieu de jolies fleurs fraiches. Service insistant pour l alcool, viennent toujours a 2 ou 3 personnes a la fois a la table.. on se sent quasiment attaque. Poisson pas cuit au gout trop puissant et texture caoutchouc. Tres decue. Belle vue, beau decor a l interieur."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Incredibly good meal.  Inventive and crative seafood menu. Service was excellent.
Enoteca Paco Perez,A beautiful restaurant with very unique dishes. I was hoping it would be  as advertised  but found the restaurant to be trying too hard. Service was incredible and very attentive. I don t think the food met the hyped up expectations. Bummer
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Dietary restrictions: Not vegan, will do vegetarian, Will try Gluten Free - double check. Food"
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,A great restaurant in every respect! The selection of wine and champagne is also first class. You have to plan at least 3 hours for the 13-course menu.
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Magnificent Sunday menu with Pacos rice as main course. Everything exquisite with excellent service and a spacious, bright and modern place"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Nothing special, the service was very slowly. I dont think its worth the price."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"It s mediocre. Let s start with the place. It s very elegant design. Nothing super special, buts it s quite nice. We had 2 servers(kind of - they served like 3, 4 tables at the same time). One guy  Omar , he was a bit hard to understand and a woman, sorry I forgot her name, but she was amazing. She was very clear when speaking, in contrast to the male waiter. Service was pretty slow. It took 2 hours for lunch, for 6 courses which were 1-2 bites, except the main course which was rice. So we had to wait like 10+ mins between dishes which were a bite away. Food had its good and bad dishes. The squid dish was below average and left a bad aftertaste. Also one of the chocolates for the final meal was also very weird with a fish taste. The best things were one of the butters for the bread(its a bit laughable that that is the best thing) and the main course, but more specifically the mushroom on it. The rest of the dish was just okay. Not mind blowing. Just okay. Some other notes, cherry desert was nice, and also the first starter. After that we had something like a gazpacho, which it was definitely one of the top dishes, but it was so little that u had to scrape it from the plate from the start. This was 120 euro per person. Definitely not worth the price. Also they served coffee and water and they included that in the bill - +10 euro, which is pathetic in my opinion. Its was okay lunch, but definitely don t recommend and will not return."
Enoteca Paco Perez,I would like to share my unique experience at Enoteca! This is the first time in my life that I have experienced fine cuisine as an art. The flavor explosion that I experienced cannot be describe with words. Every single palette was able to get to the top thanks to the chef s work of art. The service was sublime and the food  well the food  I would spend my whole pay check to get that experience back in my life! I would like to thank Daniel and Yaiza for an amazing service and for being part of this amazing experience at Enoteca! Please chef bring your art to Miami!!!
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Wasnt the best 2-star restaurant I ever ate. Great 1st courses, some of them are really amazing. Average mains.  Very average deserts (3 of them). The worst  wine paring , frankly, some of the wines were real fail. The service wasnt attentive  enough.  Work only according to scripts. Didnt care about the rest. You have greater options in Barcelona for a set tasting menu for sure."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Great experience. Super service. Very nice wine paring . Thanks to Jennifer.
Enoteca Paco Perez,The most amazing food experience Ive ever had. Every course was beautifully presented and each taste was prepared to perfection. I wish everyone would get the chance to experience this chefs masterpieces. And special mention to the sommeliers wine pairings and the pastry chefs sumptuous special dessert she created for me.
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Fantastic restaurant, staff, food and drinks. The menu consisted of 16 small dishes that looked like small beautiful works of art. Each dish also delivered an exciting taste experience."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"While staying at Hotel Arts Barcelona, my wife and I stopped in at Enoteca for a fantastic dinner. We decided to have the a la carte option, which was a great choice! I would recommend anyone who enjoys taking time through a meal, with lots of room to talk to one another to go with this option. Our meal choices: Appetizers, homemade bread, and pre-dessert. Tradition Our Rice (creamy seasonal rice, lobster mores) A Distant and Yet Near World (Japanese wagyu served in two steps) Waffle, chocolate, kumquat, coffee Paired all with a red wine from a local small home winery that makes it all by old, manual techniques. The food was amazingly prepared with the chef even demonstrating the preparation of the Wagyu. Rich flavors, smooth textures and amazing service were present through the whole meal. Every visit from our servers was accompanied with smiles and stories from the staff that kept it all very personal. The staff is from all around the world making it an added experience to hear of people s journey to Barcelona. I highly recommend coming here if you want to take the time for a long night of great food, wine, company, and an overall fantastic experience."
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"The quality of the service, food, attention to detail and the overall experience were what you d expect from a 2 time Michelin star outfit! At the end the dessert chef and the sous chef both came out to talk with us and ensure our meals were up to the mark and we had nothing but compliments to pay! I would highly recommend this establishment. Note: I did however suffer, the night after, with some food poisoning, which could have been from this restaurant or from another meal I ate in Girona, but when I communicated this to Enoteca they assured me that their produce is fresh and locally sourced and cleanly prepared."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Enoteca is one of the best dining experiences in Barcelona. My wife and I have enjoyed a few meals at Enoteca during visits to Barcelona and it never fails to amaze us. The food is exquisite with complex flavors that amaze. The service is unparalleled. We always get the pairing menu because it lets us enjoy a variety of flavors. It s pricey and takes a while, but as I mentioned above it s an experience. If you re a foodie in Barcelona, Enoteca should be on your to do list."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Excellent seafood and pairing
Enoteca Paco Perez,Modern but cozy restaurant. A delicious tasting menu. Super elaborate and ingenious. Super friendly attention. I celebrated my mothers birthday and they made a special dessert for her to put the numbers on. I loved it!!
Enoteca Paco Perez,"A combination of salty and unbalanced flavors... You have to work hard every moment to find the taste. I dont know if Im old-fashioned, but if this is the level of Michelin 2 stars, I dont want to go to Michelin restaurants higher than 2 stars in the future. Even sea urchin roe and seafood are somewhat fishy. The staff is really friendly and their explanations are detailed. The food is... amazing in many ways. I think there is a reason why reservations are easy."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Very tasty!
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Restaurant with 2 Michelin Stars located on the first floor of the Hotel Arts (5 stars great luxury). It is only open for dinner. Christmas tasting menu. Appetizers. Winter cappuccino, normal. Truffled tartlet, excellent. Flor Marina, excellent. Vol au vent de crayfish, spectacular. Sea ox soup in two textures, excellent. Breads (traditional, focaccia and brioche, excellent. Along with oils (arbequina and Llum, excellent) and butters (traditional and mushrooms and truffle (spectacular). Truffled guinea fowl cannelloni, impressive. Sea bream, good. Goat, good. Small chocolate donut, excellent. Pear, spectacular. Petit fours, excellent. The staff is excellent. Highly recommended!!!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"El mejor Restaurante de Espana, con perdon de los ya consolidados. Magnifico.!!! Parking: 100"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"The food was delicious. We had El arroz de Paco. Wine pairing was amazing, too. The employees are very kind and friendly, and explained every dish in detail. For my first day in a Michellin restaurant, it was a lovely experience. It is absolutely worth a visit. Food : 5/5 |"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Very unique adventure through so many tasty courses! Our experience involved 13 courses over 4 hours; most of the courses involved seafood creations. Any specific details of the dishes here would not do it any justice and the menu only provides a hint of what is to come.  Each course is introduced by our server with a suggestion of how to eat them. Including 3 bottles of wine for 8 people, our experience cost about 250/person.  Highly recommended!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,Fine dining at its best. Excellent service.
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Overrated restaurant. This was my 15th Michelin restaurant visit and for the first time I am very disappointed. The service is flawless but the food and plating is not Michelin 2 star quality. It feels like a tourist trap for rich clueless people that think a 700 Euro dinner is amazing because of the price tag and service and not because of the quality of the food. The tasting menue should first of all be renamed  16 spoons or 16 bites  or something because the majority of the dishes are so tiny I would not call them a dish. It is like it was plated for dolls in a doll house. For the first dish I am served chicken broth although we been promised a pescatarian menu and no bird / no meat. The best tasting dish the Red Mullet is so small it is not even a mouthful. We got 2 cm of fish. Just ridiculous and cheap. The shrimps lack seasoning and freshness of some acidic element. The shrimp is served with the black  shitstrings  intestines not removed. On a two star restaurant Come on!!! The rest of the menue is one dimensional cooking. Often under seasoned and bland. Frankly the majority of the dishes don t taste much. All desserts are boring and lacks freshness. It feels like the  chefs fokused all on Umami but forgot the other key elements to a great desserts. It is no fireworks, no explosions of tastes in our mouths. One at the table who is allergic to nuts get the food and desserts with no decorations at all and no crunch or structure. Despite the restaurant Being informed about this when the booking was done. The Autumn is the only dessert with nice decorations. It taste ok. Nothing special. The best dessert is the petit fours. It is 4 cute small cookies only millimeters in size and you feel like a giant eating them. Overall a very disappointed experience. Expect around 350 Euro a minimum per person for a dinner here. Value for money? Not at all. The first time I rather felt robbed after leaving a restaurant and I eat on fine dining restaurants on a regular basis and gladly pay for a great food experience. We shared the  restaurant with only 6 other guests on three tables. The rest of the tables were Unbooked. I understand why. Barcelona is one of my favorite cities in Europe with lots of great restaurants so choose wisely and avoid this one. I can t understand this gets 5/5 from other reviewers. This was far from that. I give this restaurant 2/5 because of the service and staff. They did a great job. But the food should be the hero and it is not."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"I really had better days in this restaurant.   the sommelier   , 3 courses was cold, waiting time between the courses 2 times more than 20 minutes"
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"The food menu was really good, not an excessive amount. The experience is good too, you can choose to be attended in different languages too. But their chair is not the most comfortable one. The wines suggested paired for us were good, but the cava was really good!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Maybe it was because of the short menu on Sunday (arroz de paco) which was very delicious but to me it seemed more like a one star experience than a two star one. Still, delicious!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Amazing experience at all levels, the restaurant is very cozy and has the perfect atmosphere for a gastronomic experience. The service was top, showing the connection between the service team and the kitchen with the perfect timings between each dish. We had the tasting menu and the food is amazing, each moment with its essence, technique and creativity. Flavors and textures that I had never experienced before, simply amazing! The temperatures of each dish are worked to perfection throughout the menu and the ingredients are of excellence. The wine pairing was very well connected during the menu. We ll comeback for sure, highly recommended!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Top 3 restaurant in my life, out of many. No words. They mixed flavors and created new ones I had never felt. Felt like discovering new colors."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"My husband booked this as our final night in Barcelona with our daughters, one of which is a pescetarian, we gave the restaurant plenty of notice. When we arrived we noticed the room and service didn t seem to meet the 2 Michelin star standard. The service was clumsy throughout from wine to food, which we were fine to overlook. But the serious frustration came when the restaurant  just completely got lazy about having a pescetarian in including just straight up leaving out meat elements of the same dish they were serving us.  The last savoury dish we had Wagyu beef, while our daughter was served beet rice?!?! Like are you kidding? When we brought up concerns to staff they boarded between defensive and dismissive and totally failed to address our concerns. Complete amateurs. This place is designed for a overpriced hotel with guests that don t know better. Tourist trap.  Total waste of time and money, so many far more exceptional places in Barcelona. Please skip this."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"You always have to ask for prices, we ordered two glasses of don perignon 50euros/glass. Hahahahahaha. It has been an impressive experience"
Enoteca Paco Perez,Amazing place! I went with my partner when we celebrated 1 year. Unbeatable treatment and services. We will return for sure!

Enoteca Paco Perez,"The service was professional and flawless, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very pleasant. Unfortunately I was mildly disappointed with the food, some dishes were very well executed, but some were bland or simply too salty. Overall I had a good experience here, but was expecting more from the food."
Enoteca Paco Perez,Incredible experience    everything very delicious
Enoteca Paco Perez,"An incredible gastronomic experience, exquisite treatment, each dish a discovery of flavors. Cozy and romantic place. They save the smallest detail. Highly recommended! Five stars and we will return!!"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Pretty normal restaurant, really. 2 Michelin stars that leave a lot to be desired. All clients are foreigners. The waiters are not at the level of 2 Michelin star service. It is clear that the restaurant is managed by Ritz-Carlton. Nothing surprising, average food, very weak service, a lot of noise in the place. 2 Michelin stars and a bill of  400 deserve a little more care. I recommend other Michelin stars in Catalonia that are infinitely better."
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,"As for the Michelin starred place everything was perfect. We had the tasting menu in Jan 2022 and it was delicious, but we would appreciate maybe more variety. Some of the dishes were composed of similar ingredients. All delicious of course. Service was impeccable. Very small and cozy place. We had a chance to stay at the hotel as well so it was a nice perk to eat right at the hotel restaurant. The bottle of wine was an excellent touch. Once they update the tasting menu for the new season we will come back for sure."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Great tasting menu, good wine pairing and EXCELLENT service"
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Lugar increible para comer y pasar un rato fantastico... Hicimos el arroz del domingo, fue bastante acertado, la atencion es super amable con muchos detalles, y la cocina del chef es sencillamente admirable...  No hay mas palabras para describirlo, nos pusieron trufa blanca en el arroz lo que le dio un sabor muy bueno y un aroma genial."
Enoteca Paco Perez,
Enoteca Paco Perez,Excellent rice. Great master chef. Congratulations.
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Friday, October 8, 2021, a great experience and highly recommended, I want to highlight the service, from the entrance with Paula, the exceptional attention with Jeimy, Danniel and Edgar, the presentation of the risotto by Francisco.

Enoteca Paco Perez,"Excellent gastronomic experience. A tasting menu that is worth it, creative and with the best seasonal products. The treatment and professionalism of the staff, also very good. The 2 Michelin stars are well deserved."
Enoteca Paco Perez,"Incredible service, really interesting dishes! The lobster and chicken rice, and the Wagyu were definitely the highlight. It is very pricey though."

Anmol Dahi Ballay,"The first place we wanted to try was this, especially since we dont have this in Netherlands. We ordered Dahi bhalle, Samosas chaat and Gol Gappay. Man it was a hit! Especially the prices were really economical! This made the experience astronomical. The taste reminded me of back home. The sauces (chatni, raaita, imli) were perfect. The staff is very friendly. They serve Biryani, Nihari and other dhaba styled food. The atmosphere is okay, nothing fancy but at least the main focus was right: food. Will visit again for snacking. Vegetarian options: Pakora, Samosas, chana chaat, gol gappay"
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"We tried this for breakfast today. We ordered Paey and chana, both were really tasty. We also tried their milk tea, it was also fantastic. Its really cheap place in barcelona if you want to eat some desi food."
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"Very good gol gappy Yummmy how do you eat in Pakistan, dahi bally also kulfi thanks for everything   if I go to barcelona I will go again eat everything"
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"Good place for desi snacks, place it so so but worth to go due their good taste and v reasonable prices"
Anmol Dahi Ballay,The most authentic pakistani street food that anybody can find in Barcelona. Its a real treat to find a place like this one. Great service and exceptional food.
Anmol Dahi Ballay,very   slowly but not bad
Anmol Dahi Ballay,Good
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,Very unsanitary and dingy. The food was below par.
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"I found this place thanks to a friend, there I ate Aloo Paratha and Samosa Chaat, great food, delicious flavors and good service. It is also worth highlighting its prices, for quality and price Anmol Dahi Ballay is a place that I will recommend and to which, without a doubt, I will return more times."
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,I went there a few times while my trip to Barcelona. Quite small place but one of the best food I ate! Food tastet really fresh and it was crazy cheap. They had a lot of vegetarian options too!
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"Hole-in-a-wall find that has a mind-blowing, delicious gol gappay/ pani puri. Small pockets of flavor with different textures. Chicken biryani has a generous-sized portion, was good but not a highlight. The eating space is very sparse and not appropriate for large groups, so probably not the best place to go for a date, just focus on the food. It s good and so affordable - incredible price to quality ratio. Staff is kind and friendly. We can t wait to be back!"
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,Im searching the shop for a cake but I cannot find but the shop I find open thank you very much the show
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,I ordered a biryani and they served me an old biryani looks like they cooked it some days ago
Anmol Dahi Ballay,Amazing pani puri and samosa chaat

Anmol Dahi Ballay,"You have to go try Golgapay, they are very good."
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"This is small restaurant with Pakistani owned, will get typical Indian foods like mirchi bajji, Pani poori, chicken biryani, sweets, juices...I have been going this since 3 yrs."
Anmol Dahi Ballay,I order shish kabab normaly you get 2 kebab now they send 2 half pieces
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,"The curry itself is okay but the pricing is not clear and changes depending on who they are serving. They don t have clear pricing for the different sizes written anywhere in the shop, presumably so they can take advantage and charge you more if you look like a tourist. In the shop next door they offer a mix of curries in a small  Handi  pot and two Nanns for 3 euros. In this place, they want to charge 5 euros for the same thing and change the price depending on the day. What is the purpose of offering two naans? That is too much bread for 1 small pot of curry. As a local customer who would have come 3-4 times a week, I want a cheap option for lunch with a mix of the vege options and 1 nann. 3-4 euros for the small pot seems fair. Then 5 euros for the large pot. I would recommend going to  Landoori Tandoori  down the road instead. For 5 euros you get a very large plate of mixed curry, a naan and yogurt mint sauce. The curry is much fresher and tastier. The staff are much friendlier."
Anmol Dahi Ballay,Good food at reasonable prices
Anmol Dahi Ballay,
Anmol Dahi Ballay,So far the best mughlai cuisine I have tried in Barcelona.

Anmol Dahi Ballay,"The wait for authentic Pakistani street food is over. Anything you ever tasted in your childhood in Pakistan and miss in Europe, you can enjoy same variety and taste in Barcelona. Everything is self made so no worries for health.  Gol gappon ka pain  was so authentic that I can rate it best among all I tasted in Pakistan. Surely will recommend to visit."

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Formal and good aesthetic restaurant, good for dates. Food is unique and wonderful taste. Love the red prawn paella, very different to other restaurant in Barcelona. Octopus is huge and very tender! Wonderful experience"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,The menu of the day was very delicious. Especially the salad was my favorite. Very good atmosphere and very friendly staff.
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Very cozy restaurant. Very attentive service and very good dishes with traditional ingredients.
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"The food was good and the place was very formal. However, we must put only one star because there was a really unfortunate misunderstanding with our reservation. We were trying to book a table on The fork with a 30% discount. The fork did not allow us to book a table for 6 (the number of people we were) so we called the restaurant to help us with the booking. We explicitly told them that we were trying to get a table on The fork but there was no  table for 6 option  and we asked them if they could book it for us instead. We were very specific about the fact that we were using The fork to get the discount. To which they answered  yes, no problem, the reservation has been made . We arrive to the restaurant, state the name of the booking and they themselves said that we had booked through The fork. We eat, enjoy, and when it comes to the payment they tell us the discount is not there. We explained the situation to the manager but there was no understanding although it was an obvious mistake or at least bad communication from their part."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Correct
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,This was a double experience - why? Because first we had some drinks and tapas on the roof in a nice view bar; great wine and small dishes to start with; then went to the main restaurant - and that was an excellent and enjoyable experience;  so many dishes  ! Vegetarian options: Mushrooms .
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"I have tried the  23 menu that they have during the week, that is what I can comment on. The food is very delicious, it looks very elaborate, the bad thing is the size of the portions which seemed ridiculously small to me, instead of eating two dishes what they serve you is like two tapas and in the end you leave hungry. Very nice restaurant and good service."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"We went with a discount from El Tenedor, the restaurant is nice, it is in a hotel. The food was good, not very abundant and quite high prices. What bothered us is that we asked for some water at the end of the meal (my friend had to take a pill) and they brought us a glass bottle from home, with water. We tried it and it was totally tap water, that taste was horrible... on the bill we saw that they charged us  5!! We complained but they had the audacity to tell us that it was not from the tap, but distilled! Sorry, but the taste of tap water is perfectly recognizable, apart from the fact that they charged us  8 for two cuts that we had not ordered and that were withdrawn from the account when we complained. I did not like the attention and we will not return"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"It is a beautiful, welcoming restaurant, with attentive and friendly service. But I have 2 things to point out: 1. We ordered rice with seafood for 2 people (paella type). On a very thin layer of rice, even tasty, but a little dry, two sad prawns and 8 miserable, very thin slices of octopus. Even if the dish was just for one person, it would be an average portion and the amount of seafood would still be ridiculously small. Its  25 per person. Its immoral, because were not talking about extremely expensive products - there are two soft prawns and maybe 50g of octopus. The next day we paid for a larger dose of superior quality and flavor, in a restaurant that was even more beautiful than this  9. Needless to say, we went for a snack after leaving the restaurant. Not really my kind of fauna. 2. Dessert cutlery plates to eat the main course? It doesnt work for me."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Very good service, very friendly and attentive. Elegant atmosphere with a live musician. The food is very good, especially the tapas and especially the bravas. Vegetarian options: There arent too many options"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Very well taken care of
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Excellent restaurant...where you can enjoy magnificent dishes, very well prepared and presented...and extraordinary staff treatment...which is appreciated... Thank you so much"

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Rrstaurant in a pedestrian zone on the first floor of the hotel. I really liked the attention. Delicious cuisine, menu of the day  23 with meat or fish, dessert, water, glass of wine or beer. It was all very good."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Delicious breakfast and excellent service from the host and waiters.
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Great place, with amazing food and  service."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"The food of 10. The bravas are delicious. The Iberian ham croquettes are a success. Creamy and crunchy. You cant ask for more from a croquette. The noodle casserole with Iberian pork and red shrimp is a delight. Perfect and winning combination. The Kefir lemon pie type lime pie is delicious. Viewed kitchen giving a plus. The price of the food is very reasonable according to the quality. To put a but the price of the drink. 5 for house water is excessive. The  10 summer red is amazing. The  4.5 coffees are not adequate. If they corrected the high drink prices it would be fantastic. Otherwise a 10 in everything. In food, in attention and in service."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"It was very unexpected to receive such a level of service and quality of food in a non-Mechelin restaurant. Everything was great: food, service and atmosphere. I came at the invitation of friends and was completely unfamiliar with the menu. The waitress Stella helped us and recommended the best dishes according to our wishes. And the holiday has begun!!! Everything was very tasty, but my favorite was the steak tartare - the best of my life. And also a Catalan dish - meat and mushrooms mixed inside a huge wheel of cheese! It was just a blast!!! The  Chocolate World  dessert with very high quality tea perfectly complemented the evening. Many thanks to the whole team - you made my evening!!! We will definitely come back here again!!!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Nice service. Feel welcome and the food is amazing.
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,A paella for 2 people (50 euros) with a bitter taste and minimal portions. Sparkling water  4.50. Stay away from this place!!
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Fauna Restaurant, and it was unforgettable experience! The menu boast a diverse selection of dishes, each prepared with creativity and passion. From the appetizer to the desserts, each dish is a perfect balance of texture and flavor! We tried a selection of tapas, the Iberian ham was so delicious, also the Iberian ham croquettes and selections of the cheese    Then was a main dish, it was a grilled octopus, it was so delicious and soft , I choose mashed potato on a side! The diamond of our dinner was creamy cheesecake and lime cream pie   it was so tasty! Also one important thing that has this place is a live music, Spanish guitar, it s made our dinner even more special! I will highly recommend to all my friends visiting Fauna restaurant in Kimpton Vividora, because this place have a charm and so delicious food!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Delicious, there is nothing more to say, great service, a place to enjoy its cuisine on another level."

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Adresse moyenne, cuisine correcte mais cadre sans atmosphere"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Fabulous food and excellent service! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Fauna restaurant in the Klimpton Vividora Hotel (4th Sept 23). We had a wonderful dinner, and the overall experience was superb. We were greeted by Lucio who made us feel very welcome. The Fauna is very stylish, quiet, and relaxing. It was the perfect ambiance we were looking for. Lucio was very attentive, and his suggestions were absolutely spot on for one of the best food experiences we have had. To start, we shared Bunuelos de Bacalo, Croqueta Ceps, and Las Bravas de Vivi (a take on patatas bravas which was superb). Our main course was a melt in the mouth Solomillo (beef), with quirky the steak knives :-) This was a truly wonderful dining experience, I would certainly go again when next in Barcelona, and definitely recommend the Fauna restaurant if you are visiting this wonderful city!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"We have tried the weekend menu, which goes from more to less. The starters were very good, variety and all very good. The rice is quite rich in flavor, but just as hard. And finally, the desserts do not save any of the two that we have tried. To this you add a painful service, where the only waitress hides cleaning glasses instead of serving the tables, and a practically deserted restaurant, because it makes you leave feeling that you have paid a lot for very little. And as we say goodbye, it turns out that they lock you inside"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"The fritters of cod and steak tartar prepared on site are very good, the Iberian penne seconds are good but a bit low for the price since you also pay for the side dish if you want it separately. Very good desserts. The service must be said to be excellent and the atmosphere very calm. However, the prices of drinks are exorbitant. A bottle of wine that is actually worth 11 euros cannot be charged at 32, and for an open bottle of water that is called km 0, probably because it is from the tap filtered with osmosis, they charge you 5 euros. Apart from the fact that, as unfortunately happens in almost all restaurants, tap water is still not offered to customers free of charge as required by law 7/2022 of April 10, 2022 apart from the paid drinks that are want to consume The restaurant offers overall good food and EXCELLENT service but we honestly found the drinks thing overdone."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,the staff speaks Russian
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Dining at Fauna is an experience that stimulates the senses. The chefs creations are very successful, highlighting the cod fritters and the tuna tartare. The sensational cheesecake! The pleasant and professional treatment of the people who serve you helps a lot for the environment."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Delicious tasting menu.
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Everything was from end to end very very very delicious!!!! Quiet atmosphere where you can talk...ideal for couples...exemplary service, very attentive... Many thanks to Lucios professionalism..."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,Service and food fantastic
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Locale molto carino allinterno di un hotel vicino alla vecchia Cattedrale.  Pietanze super eccellenti , abbiamo cenato veramente bene.  Ma, nonostante la cameriera sia stata eccellente e molto gentile, non posso dare una votazione alta poiche e inaccettabile aspettare oltre 1 ora  per un riso con pesce. Mi dispiace perche la qualita avrebbe meritato un punteggio piu alto."

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"The place is super cozy, quiet and very  instagrammable  too, all things considered. The attention from the moment we arrived has been wonderful, Laura welcomed us with a smile, very helpful and willing to assist us with everything we needed. During the evening we were assisted by Estela, who answered all possible questions, suggested and recommended us based on our preferences and invited us to visit the hotels rooftop, also beautiful! The menu is Mediterranean food, everything is a 10! In short, we did not know it but I am sure we will return. Thank you very much for everything!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"I have had the pleasure of having a drink and dinner on the roof top they have. It has been a spectacular experience from minute zero. We have met Ricardo, who has attended to us, and who has treated us spectacularly. We will definitely return with my partner. We loved it. Thank you!"

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Delicious and different. If you like trying new flavors, you wont be disappointed. We ordered 3 tickets. Anchovy tapas, ham croquettes and a sobrasada with honey. The most original and rich. Innovative. The turbot fort was very delicious and salted chocolate for dessert in a very rich version with many textures. Everything delicious. Stella was our waitress and she was very friendly"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"A great team attended to us in a very familiar and friendly way. The food was very good, everything treated with respect. To highlight the morels and oysters of excellent quality. Kid-friendliness: We went with our baby without any problem."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"A great discovery in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. Food, service and brutal atmosphere! Highly recommended!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Inside is modern and stylish. Very nice, slightly upscale, relaxed, quieter vibe. The food is quite good but portion is a bit smaller. Service was excellent. This is a nice restaurant inside the Kimpton Vividora hotel. Just a short walk from La Rambla."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"What a lovely dinner experience we had after a full day of sightseeing and shopping!  We were greeted by such friendly and welcoming staff. Stella spoke many languages all night making sure that all customers felt at home. We heard Catalan, Italian, Portuguese, French and English in the same evening of service. The ambiance and food were incredible. Stella was extremely observant and had wonderful recommendations to create a beautiful experience for my husband and me. Service was responsive and warm. We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Barcelona!  The restaurant is lucky to have someone like Stella there to interact with guests and create an unforgettable experience. As a vegetarian, I had beautiful options. The bravas de Vivi were so innovative. They were an upscale version of the traditional patatas bravas with layers of thinly sliced potatoes stacked together. The croquettes were exceptional. My husband had some with codfish and mine were vegan with porcini mushrooms.  I almost ordered the papardelle pasta which was vegetarian but I was looking for something lighter so I went with the baby broccoli and kale which had divino tomatoes that were bursting with flavor!  If I had room for desert, I would have kept ordering. It was a treat to stumble across this restaurant at the Kimpton Vividora Hotel in Barcelona! Vegetarian options: Papardelle pasta, kale salad, mushroom croquettes, grilled artichokes, grilled veggies, olives, bravas de vivi,  many nice options. Dietary restrictions: Mushroom (porcini) croquettes were made with almond milk making them suitable for vegans."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"The service was a little slow and the atmosphere was for tourists. The food was good and the service too, but slow"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Very pleasant experience. The food was very good, the atmosphere very careful and in the service we had Bryan as a waiter who was spectacular."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"We had a dinner at the restaurant. The staff is impressive and good service. However, we disappointed with the food. The taste is too salty especially Paella. The dessert is good. We had the lemon pie."

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Restaurant in the center of Barcelona. The place is very beautiful along with the presentation of the dishes. We ate croquettes, steak tartare, cannelloni, fricando and for dessert a cheesecake. Everything was very good, you can see high quality products. The only thing I didnt like was the waiting time, thats why I gave it a 4/5. Since between courses I could spend 30 minutes calmly and there were very few people. Finally, if you eat there they give you 2 hours of free parking."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Spectacular experience in the center of Barcelona. The attention from everyone was exquisite at all times.

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"It is a not very large but cozy restaurant. It is located on the 1st floor of the Kimpton Vividora hotel. The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date, very calm and elegant. We ordered porcini and ham croquettes and also octopus and fish, I dont really remember what it was called. And cheesecake for dessert. We liked all the dishes we ordered although I would like the menu to be broader. For example, they dont have salmon tartare. Service is good but it is not the best I have found. In general, the experience was quite positive, especially because of the exquisite food. I might come back to this place for a romantic dinner."
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,A pleasant discovery in the heart of the old city. The best cod fritters Ive ever tasted. Parellada rice very tasty and at the perfect cooking point. Very kind and friendly staff and modern but welcoming atmosphere. Very well made desserts (lime cake and very creamy cheesecake) and the perfect coffee.
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"We had dinner there and everything was very good, and they treated us very well, thank you Ricardo and Bryan for your great professionalism... And by the way, I recommend the ham croquettes and the meat cannelloni, super good!!!!!"

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Yesterday we went with few friends to celebrate Xmas time and new years and we had a great time there. The food was totally delicious and the people there made us feel like at home. We had Ricardo serving our table and the way he treated us and how well explained every single dish and wine, made us live a great experience.

Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Instagram: @nata_o_barcelone I liked it - I recommend it. In the heart of the Gothic Quarter, in a cozy room, a set lunch at a very friendly price (23 euros with dessert and drink). Beautiful presentation, tasty, friendly service - everything is at a good level. It was interesting to try pumpkin soup with white chocolate and cod tartar. And the dessert is just bomb! It s worth a look here just for that reason :)"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"I was here to eat with my girlfriend, the place is very welcoming as are the staff. The atmosphere is very relaxing and at times romantic. The food is very good and is served with particular choreographies on the plate. I ordered a slice and the cooking was as requested. We drank some pretty good champagne. In conclusion, the restaurant offers excellent quality food at modest prices. I absolutely recommend!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"6 people went to dinner. We have enjoyed a delicious dinner, quality food, friendly and professional atmosphere. Maria, manager and Manuel, waiter, make one feel super comfortable, offering a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere and maintaining professionalism and attention at all times. With DJ, show cooking they create a different place that they do not usually have in hotel restaurants, which makes it stand out from the rest. Thank you all!!!"
Casa de Vivi - Fauna Restaurant,"Instagram: @befoodie_myfriend Hello Foodies! Vibrates to the rhythm of the Gothic quarter Today, we are located in the lively streets of the cultural heart of Barcelona, also home of @kimptonvividora.    This design hotel perfectly represents the interior design of the houses of the old Catalan bourgeoisie. Kimpton Vividora is a place that offers a wide variety of different spaces, including our current restaurant @faunarestaurant,   a point of modernized versions of traditional local cuisine. The Mediterranean food dinners they serve left us dazzled. So, we chose some starters of anchovies with mata, a couple of fried XL oysters    and a splendid squid and red shrimp rice paella.   To close, a pear dessert with elderberry cream. In short, a creative and quality dinner! * Anchovies with creamy bush and cane honey. * XL fried oysters barbecue style. * Squid and red shrimp rice paella. * Pear, elderberry cream, lemon gel and ginger bread. 50 pp approx (  -   ) Carrer del Duc, 15. Barcelona, Catalonia."

The Sichuan style braised beef noodles are really spicy and flavorful, and the sugar garlic is also super delicious! ! The pigs trotters are also cut very thoughtfully! The jasmine-flavored lemon   is also delicious. This restaurant is really good. It s located near the Arc de Triomphe. Come and try it! !"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"It has been in trial operation for three days and I have eaten there three times. As an old Lanzhou native, I highly recommend it. The noodles are very chewy and the soup is very authentic. It is the most delicious beef noodles in Lanzhou. This will be my canteen from now on"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Excellent food, flavor and gastronomic origin.."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Best Chines Ramen I have had outside of China. Perfect Sichuan spice flavor full of heat! Dont go full heat unless you want to sweat!!!    Im definitely coming back next time Im in Barcelona!
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Very charming place and delicious food. We ordered the two recommended ramens and it was a great success! The attention was 10, we will return for sure!"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"We ordered two different bowls and love them both. Flavorful warm broth that makes a cold day in Barcelona more enjoyable. The menu has distinctive and fun dishes (chicken feet!) Prices are very reasonable. Staff is friendly and attentive. Funny, this is the one good meal that we had in Barcelona!"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Delicious and authentic There are many special dishes, friends, you can try it! The boss is very nice! !"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Although portions were on the small side, the food was of high quality and very tasty. There was a lot of everything in the soup noodles. The toilets could be better maintained. The atmosphere is modern and the service is very attentive and polite. I would go again."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"The ramen tastes quite authentic. The salt on the hand pancake omelette was not evenly sprinkled, so it was a bit salty and had some minor flaws."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Delicious, I couldnt finish it"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"It s always hard to judge Chinese food outside of China and the US because restaurants always have to somewhat cater to local European tastes. We ordered a variety of foods just to try and most items were good. The noodles were tasty. The two fried chicken appetizers can use stronger taste. A few of the fried appetizers all rely on the same sauce. Other than that, the staff were super friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in Barcelona."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Authentic Chinese restaurant! Lanzhou noodle soup is spectacular, I was in Lanzhou a few years ago and it is the authentic recipe. 100% recommended!"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,All I can say is that the noodle soup just kept getting better the more you ate it.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Delicious noodle and seaweed salad. Thanks.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,The noodles with broth are excellent - you can ask for spicy sauce - and I loved the sweet pickled garlic. Highly recommended!
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,a nonsense
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"The ramen is really good, the soup is delicious, the noodles are chewy, and the side dishes are delicious. I feel like Im back in China! Very good"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Marvelous. We have been delighted by the flavor and the attention. To highlight the house rolls and the Cantonese-style pork. The place is very neat and clean.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Ramen with a good amount of noodles and flavorful broth
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"I ordered the ramen with clear soup and Laotan sauerkraut. The soup base tasted okay, but the noodles were really hard. Maybe the real Lanzhou ramen is like this, I don t know. The fried chicken is crispy but not marinated. Its just a fair expression of my personal opinion. If you dont like it, dont criticize it."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"I went with my partner and we ordered ramen. It is very different from the photograph you see, there is a VERY small amount of noodles, meat, in fact the plate is half empty... I havent even filled myself and I normally eat little. The prices are also very high for the amount you get. The staff is also bad, whatever you tell them they are not going to let you finish talking, they are going to tell you that you have to order it by QR code. Any questions I had about the ingredients of the ramen in case it was spicy, he told me to read what it said in the qr instead of answering something so simple. I wanted to ask for a napkin, the waitress didnt let me finish the sentence and told me to ask for it there, without knowing what I wanted or anything. They dont seem to want to work because of the attitude they have."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"When I first saw the decoration of this shop, I planned to go in and try it. A bowl of noodles was 9.5  and based on the pictures on the menu, I thought the portion would be plenty, but when the noodles arrived, I was dumbfounded. It s less than half a bowl and it s basically just soup. A few slices of beef and noodles are missing. The picture has absolutely nothing to do with the actual thing. When I first served it, I thought it was a mistake. But I actually got Lanzhou Ramen. I couldnt see a single Chinese person at work, and the waitress service attitude was very poor. When I asked if the noodles were spicy, she pointed to the QR code on the table and asked me to read it myself. I was convinced anyway."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Delicious! We will repeat for sure
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Delicious food   The owner is very friendly.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,One sip of soup is the first sip of soup! Save money on air tickets and get home. I feel like there is something wrong with the store name.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"I have always wondered why there are no good noodle restaurants in Barcelona. Now I finally tried it. The noodles are delicious. I put a few spoons of chili oil on it and it is so fragrant! Its really a bowl of Lanzhou. The cold dishes are also very delicious. Its a pity that I didnt try the chicken feet, they were sold out..."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Good noodles but pricey for the food. Had the regular Lanzhou style noodles, the broth with the noodles were tasty, the meat was alright, and the veggies were good. A menu option would be neat, as Ive been to a couple of places where you can get an entree, the ramen, a drink and dessert for almost the same price as the noodles alone cost me here (gotta point out that they were more expensive than usual because I had them to go, Id guess)."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Quiet place, generous portions and quite cheap price compared to other restaurants. A great discovery. Very pleasant and helpful service."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"The ramen was very good, the chicken legs also surprised us a lot. We will repeat for sure"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Big bright ramen restaurant with a warm welcoming waiting room. The best homemade ramen in BCN for sure! The soup was tasty, too. And other cold dishes was nice but my favorite is the  roujiamo . Juicy meat and green pepper covered by toasted Chinese soft bread  So yummy don t know how to describe  You won t miss it! AND!! There s a baby changing table in the toilet!!! So thoughtful Kid-friendliness: There s a baby changing table in the toilet Wheelchair accessibility: A big toilet with armrests"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,The soup base of Lanzhou Ramen is very fresh and the noodles are delicious and chewy! recommend! ! !
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Very original, beautiful quality. Recommended to try"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"If you enter an Asian restaurant and to begin with 90% of the public is Asian, that is already a guarantee of quality. Just start, you can also order what you are going to order yourself without waiting for the waiter using the QR, a 10! And the perfect food! A ramen for me and chicken wings for the kids so everyone was happy. The Mochis for dessert were great. In short 10/10 We will be back!"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"Authentic and delicious, medium size"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Very authentic and rich
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"After observing silently for a long time, the proprietress quietly opened the business yesterday   I can say responsibly that the clear soup Lanzhou Ramen is undoubtedly the first in Barcelona! Whether it is the soup or the noodles, there is nothing to choose from. Except for the ventilation that needs to be improved, I have no other opinions. I have eaten the most authentic Lanzhou ramen in Spain in the past ten years. It is so comfortable. I will definitely come again!"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"I ordered sparkling water and the waiter gave me normal water. After reminding me, I settled the bill as normal water. The waiter was very nice and gave me five stars. For some reason, I ordered pickled cabbage noodles. The noodles were chewy, but the soup was lukewarm. It felt quite cold in this weather, which affected the taste."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"The noodles are very chewy, the soup is very flavorful, and the environment is very appetizing! Recommended Comfortable food and excellent taste!"
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Traditional flavor!
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Super delicious! Specially recommend Sichuan style braised beef
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"As a kid from Lanzhou, I can only say that after finishing this bowl of noodles, I feel so satisfied."
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,I have tasted the most authentic Lanzhou Ramen in Barcelona. The spicy oil is super fragrant and affordable. The drink jasmine lemon tea is also delicious. Highly recommended ~
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,Very good ramen and very friendly staff
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,It took 50 minutes to deliver the food. Very bad service
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,As a Lanzhou beef noodles certified by Lanzhou people! I want to squat in front of the door and eat a bowl every day
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,The newly opened Lanzhou Ramen tastes very good and the soup base is very fragrant. The service attitude is also good. I hope there will be a choice of ramen thickness in the future.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,The restaurant is newly opened. It has a nice environment and good service. The noodles are more delicious and come in a variety of tastes. There are also side dishes to choose from. The boss is very nice.
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,I am so happy to be able to eat such delicious ramen in Barcelona! Im looking forward to the other sides!
Maji Beef Noodles Ma Ji Lan Zhou Niu Rou Mian ,"All very good and very friendly. We ordered tempura prawns and gyozas to share (I loved them!!) and the beef ramen, also very good and a lot of quantity too. You can tell that everything is homemade! Good value for money. We will be back!"

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"We decided on this place for our 40th birthday celebration and we were totally right! We went blindly because we had never been, we only knew that they had a 40 euro menu on the weekend. The attention was exceptional from the moment we entered the hotel, we were able to enjoy the beautiful hotel lobby having a small vermouth before entering the restaurant to eat. The surprise was even greater when we saw the beautiful table that had been prepared for us, it looked like a wedding   The satisfaction continued to increase with the menu we tasted and of course with the service received. The whole family had a very pleasant and pleasant evening, since the idea was to go up to the terrace but due to the rainy day we had no option, but in the restaurant we enjoyed it very much. In addition to the menu, the family made a surprise with a cake with candles and they served it to us without increasing the cost. Place to highlight and recommend for any type of celebration and/or evening   Thank you very much for everything"

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"Last Saturday, February 2 at around 7:30 p.m. I asked a waiter that please I need to use the bathroom urgently and he replied that the bathroom is only for customer use, I thanked him and left. It seemed to me to be a regrettable and poorly accepted response and way of acting. In my case, due to health problems, I needed to use the bathroom and I was denied."

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"With view of the Cathedral Barcelona right in front of our table, we knew were paying for an experience more than anything else.

Wheelchair accessibility: Easy access to outdoor seating."

Restaurant Catedral 1951,Notre meilleure experience culinaire a Barcelone cet ete. Le cadre et le restaurant sont bien entendu irreprochables mais la cuisine aussi.

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"Excellent food and fantastic service, great place for people watching lots of atmosphere in the plaza."
Restaurant Catedral 1951,"Today we had one of the most shocking experiences in Barcelona after we tried to find a seat on the terrace of this restaurant. The waiter was rude and spoke to us in a condescending manner, in front of other guests. Such a disappointment for such a reputable restaurant by the Cathedral."

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"My sister and I stumbled upon this place when we had been walking all day, and we were happy to find a lovely shaded patio table.  The waitress, Irene, couldnt have been more accommodating and gracious.  She served us wine and tapas, chatted easily and shared about living her whole life in Barcelona.  In a city of friendly people, her hospitality and kindness even rose above. Our table had a spectacular view of the Barcelona Cathedral, and the bustling plaza in front.  The restaurant is beautiful inside, too, and we will certainly return with our friends."

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"This was a very delicious restaurant at Hotel Colon. The best place for beautiful views of the Barcelona Cathedral. You can either sit outside, inside, or on the rooftop. We originally sat on the rooftop and the views were prime of the cathedral. It was a little too hot so we dined inside. The nachos were delicious as was the burger. The burger was probably the best dish we ordered here, I highly recommend it!! Very reasonable prices too."
Restaurant Catedral 1951,You should taste their sangria    but nothing for beginner
Restaurant Catedral 1951,The service was extremely slow on all the things we ordered. They forgot several times to bring us things. The value of the dishes in general is much lower than the price they charge. Finally they brought the bill wrong and gave us no response to our complaints.
Restaurant Catedral 1951,I made a reservation and they didnt show it to me. They have made my plan totally change
Restaurant Catedral 1951,"I recommend you visit and stop by Restaurant Catedral 1951. Excellent service, freshly made and good food. In general, great quality and unique atmosphere.

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"I really enjoyed the burger an the staff was friendly. The sangria though felt like bottled wine with ice and sliced fruits, so did not enjoyed it very much"

Restaurant Catedral 1951,"We went for lunch on Christmas Day, with a set menu that was good enough. They allowed us to make changes without increasing the final price and we were pretty tipped. On the other hand, the place is beautiful, with minimalist decor in white and gray tones and the waiters were very friendly, considering that they were working on Christmas Day"
Restaurant Catedral 1951,"The most beautiful and welcoming restaurant in Barcelona. Quality and professionalism in equal parts. Thanks Chus, you make it that way."

Restaurant Catedral 1951,Very nice restaurant. Very good food with nice prices. The bread is amazing... And the croquette with jamon is fantastic...
Restaurant Catedral 1951,Very rich and excellent service
Restaurant Catedral 1951,Dismal welcome! We were just listened to when asking for a table and rejected with contempt... even the locals were shocked. Politeness is an unknown term in this place.

We ordered 2 offers of shawarman with potatoes and Cocacola and my partner stressed to them that they will add a lot of cheese for which they charge you an additional 1 euro, the thing is that when my partners arrived it did not have cheese and I called them and they told him that They couldnt change it because the next order they would add cheese and to make matters worse they told him not to call him because it wouldnt bother him... He had to go to the shawarman to have it done again and I give it 1 star because if not no let me publish it"
Gujrat Grill BBQ Restaurant,"Very good pizza, I leave them 4 stars, I removed one for not treating the workers well"
Gujrat Grill BBQ Restaurant,"They dont respect late customer, I have been so many times, they charged me patata Fritos 3euro as they cost only 1.50euro always. When I asked some employee showed me burger caja para llavar cost 1.50euro but next they charged me as usual 1.50 for what I paid before 3euro. They have good Asian food n why they cheat to customer for so little penny? I must say I work as chef in well-known japanese restaurant in Barcelona. You must honest with your customer."

The Healthiest Choice,Delicious food delivered al over Barcelona!
The Healthiest Choice,"Im ordering regularly and the food is each time well prepared, healthy and delicious! Definitely recommended for easy lunch alternative to cooking yourself!"
The Healthiest Choice,"I am very happy with The Healthiest Choice, I have been with them for many years, the food is very good, they have never failed me and the service is exquisite. I have already recommended it to my acquaintances. At Christmas, they also make a first class menu!! Thank you"
The Healthiest Choice,"I ordered catering for different sizes of teams  throughout a week for work lunch to our office. Everyone was so pleased with the food! Finally something really tasty and not our own boring canteen.   For smaller groups I chose the healthy bowl menus (with delicious desserts and drinks), for the bigger groups we had buffet style lunch. There were always great vegetarian/vegan options offered. I would highly recommend The Healthiest Choice and I cant wait for the next occasion to sample their food. Thank you!"
The Healthiest Choice,"2 weeks in on the meal prep delivery, tasty and healthy food. Exactly what I was looking for. The medium portions was not enough for me but I m a male who exercises daily so decided on the large. Will definitely continue to use them. Have recommended them to my girlfriend who orders the medium and she is happy."
The Healthiest Choice,"Im extremely happy with the Healthiest Choice service and menu. I ordered a catering for a work event, great support in composing menu, organizing delivery details, etc. and most importantly delicious food, quality ingredients. 50 people well fed and happy :) Thank you!"
The Healthiest Choice,"Always when Im looking for healthy food, I order it from The Healthiest Choice. For me the best option for healthy food in Barcelona."
The Healthiest Choice,"The Healthiest Choice in Barcelona is a fantastic place that offers delicious and nutritious meals. The menu is full of healthy options, from salads and sandwiches to vegetarian dishes. All the ingredients are locally sourced and the food is cooked with love and care. It is a great spot for those looking for a healthy and tasty meal. The place offers a wide selection of dishes,"
The Healthiest Choice,Always a good choice
The Healthiest Choice,The worst vegan food I have ever had. They made a mistake on a plate and put egg on me.
The Healthiest Choice,
The Healthiest Choice,"2 small dry vegetable patties is what we got instead of jackfruit pulled pork with some mushrooms and potatoes. We even paid an extra supplement for the vegan jackfruit version of the pulled pork.  20.90 for something you didnt even order. Insulting. Will never order from them again. They replied to my email, basically saying, we didnt have anymore and you wont get your money back, have a nice day"
The Healthiest Choice,"Excellent service and very good food, highly recommended!!"
The Healthiest Choice,
The Healthiest Choice,Speechless...
The Healthiest Choice,"I have bought from this place through the app Too good to go but as this app doesnt support reviews Im writing here. Im not going to talk about the value (although half a plate of pasta and a bit of rice for original price of 12 ?  ) but both the pasta and the rice were severely undercooked, crunching under my teeth. The pasta had a bit od sauce on it which I initially thought was pesto but had no flavor whatsoever. If this is what they serve to regular customers then this is hands down the worst restaurant i have ever eaten at."
The Healthiest Choice,"Best meal prep in town. Always puntual, tasty and nutritious."
The Healthiest Choice,I just paid 8 euros for 200g of rice and a piece of meat. They put it on a large plate but when you move the food to the side that is the amount of food they sent me for 8 euros. Finish in 3-4 spoons. The smallest portion I have ever seen. (
The Healthiest Choice,"Ideal for the day when you dont want to cook and you dont want to eat junk food, the truth is that I was very pleased with the menu, I was lucky enough to try the salmon which was Excellent and the overall combination of the dish was very balanced and full of flavor, I tried The dessert that was included in the menu was delicious, congratulations to the THC team."
The Healthiest Choice,"I highly  recommand this for people looking for high quality food, and capacity to adapt quantity, protein vegan etc"
The Healthiest Choice,"Excellent restaurant for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Great quality of raw materials with very well balanced international flavors. You always get positive surprises. They also have daily food that they deliver to your home with a great variety at an unbeatable price. 100% recommendable"
The Healthiest Choice,"OUTSTANDING! Hands down the best meal prep I ve ever had. The food is not only clean and absolutely delicious, but it is delivered fresh to your door daily. Jess was overly responsive and beyond gracious. The true mark of a dedicated business owner. I travel all over the world and I ve had food prep wherever I can. This has been the most amazing experience yet. Thank you Jess and John for keeping me fed and healthy so I can focus on my training and my business.   ."
The Healthiest Choice,"The best choice for eat real in Barcelona, awesome food, good taste and delivery in time !"
The Healthiest Choice,The true Food
The Healthiest Choice,"I ordered a pack with the TooGoodToGo application and it was good, the food was good, healthy and they included a drink"
The Healthiest Choice,
The Healthiest Choice,"Awesome food. I eat here most days and absolutely love it. Theres always such variety to the food, its incredibly healthy and delicious! After eating 3 meals a day there, most days for a couple of weeks I felt more energised, focused and happy. Couldnt recommend enough! Thank you!"
The Healthiest Choice,"Incredible treatment, super nice people and delicious food, 100% recommended!"
The Healthiest Choice,"Usually good food but once it made me and several friends sick. Edit: the CEO calls me mean for discussing a food-safety incident.  At least six of us got sick simultaneously and in the same way after eating their lunch.  We think it must have been some vegetables, as both vegans and non-vegans woke up in the middle of the night with bad stomach problems.  Healthiest choice was unable to identify the problem--the kitchen did not test the food we had eaten.  They only tested following days food (from which no one had gotten sick).  Healthiest choice then used this lack of evidence to announce that their kitchen was not responsible.  I understand mistakes happen in even the cleanest kitchens.  But it is annoying when customers get sick and the business believes it is the real victim."
The Healthiest Choice,The quality of the food incredible. Phenomenal customer service. Without a doubt my first choice when eating.
The Healthiest Choice,"I really liked the place, the food was very good and with a variety of healthy products. Very friendly staff. I always recommend it"
The Healthiest Choice,Very good food. Its worth it
The Healthiest Choice,"Update (July 2021, app 10 months after my positive review below). Many people at my company (at least 6 who replied to an institute-wide email; not many are willing to share their intestinal problems with all their co-workers so the real number is probably higher)  got food poisoning from one of their lunches!! Our health and safety department, as well purchasing officer contacted them but to my understanding, they are not taking any responsibility. So that s a downgrade to one star. Previous review was: Life-saver! Our cafeteria practically has shut down for the Covid restrictions, and healthiestchoice has been a great source for lunch. I really enjoy the choices (most of the time)!"
The Healthiest Choice,Amazing healthy home cooked food with the kindest and nicest staff. Will come again
The Healthiest Choice,"only for the coffee - very poor quality, they prepare it from capsules. Stay away if looking for good coffee."
The Healthiest Choice,"Quality products cooked with dedication and good home service, thank you for the service"
The Healthiest Choice,"Unfortunately, it doesnt look like the pictures. Somehow it looks half-opened. Only one meal is offered, which is heated up in the microwave. The selection of drinks is very small. Is this the healthiest choice? I dont think so. The staff is friendly."
The Healthiest Choice,Healthy fresh and tasty food.

Daily tapas bar restaurant,"Neighborhood bar where the service is good and the tapas are delicious, but I dont know if there was coicide that day... but the bar was very full and there were people who looked like they were the owners setting up the tables to their liking, dragging chairs and making voices... No one in charge told them absolutely anything, a total lack of respect. I doubt I will return, I felt very uncomfortable... at most if we order it will be to take away and eat it quietly at home..."

Bites Restaurant,"World class attention to detail by the team, they took note that it was my partners birthday and they wrote a handwritten letter."
Bites Restaurant,"First, I had a green salad with passion fruit vinaigrette, which not only could I not find anywhere, but it also had a significant excess of salt. Its a salad with nothing special that costs  18. You can tell that the ingredients are of quality, but it seems excessive to me. For the main course, I had chicken cooked at low temperature with rosemary and lemon, with seasonal vegetables. Without further ado. Little dressing and very little flavor. Vegetables without any grace and Im also still looking for rosemary and lemon. This costs a whopping  32. Dessert well, I had the carrot cake that comes with a curious presentation. Quite successful although not the best I have eaten in my life.  10 When I complain, they give me coffee ( 7) In short, a meal that could pass for a  15 menu. Good service, very attentive to everything. The place is spectacular. Very overrated and quite disappointed."
Bites Restaurant,Omg ! Omg ! Best carrot cake I ve ever tasted. I am a huge fan of carrot cake and order it everywhere and there s only a few places that do it right. This place is the best I have ever had and I ve been to France
Bites Restaurant,"Sorry but these prices are just ridiculous, 15 euro for one Pepsi and a simple sandwich? And it wasn t even that great."
Bites Restaurant,"I recommend it, it is located in the lobby of the Art Hotel, the breakfast is elegant and delicious/brunch, the service is wonderful and the sessions are comfortable and elegant, indoor and outdoor seating, the cappuccino and mocha coffee is perfect    The waffles are delicious and all the orders in the attached pictures were successful and delicious."
Bites Restaurant,Good coffee. Victor the barista is very good professional. Next time we will try the Irish coffee.
Bites Restaurant,very nice and cozy place! nice and polite staff. seasonal coffee is just fantastic!     beautiful view from the windows ...
Bites Restaurant,7.19 for a specialty coffee to take away... a shame. The coffee costs  2.50 if you buy its exclusive cup and pay  10. Not anymore.

Pizza Local,"I wasnt expecting much, but all the pizzas were light and delicious! It was so good and not too salty Clara is also quite good compared to other tapas restaurants. Foreigners followed suit by offering 1 pizza per person, but I think it would be okay for those who want a second meal to just have 1 pizza."
Pizza Local,"The dough of the pizzas is    , the amount of ingredients and their combination is very well balanced... You can taste classic pizzas, like the chefs recipe... Our choice: chefs pizza     , vegetables and 4 cheeses, and Cheese cake, to give a sweet note..."

Pizza Local,"It happened to me that I went to dinner at this place, when I entered and asked for a table for one person, the waitress of the place rudely told me that they had no more place when when I looked, 2 tables were already unoccupied. Without saying anything I go outside the restaurant to wait 2 minutes for the table to clear and I go back in, at that moment the owner helps me and I ask her again if she has a table for one person and she very kindly directs me to it, in The moment the owners attention was very kind, but when the previous waitress gave me the food, she left the plate just like that on the table next to me, very bad attention from that person. As for the food, I can say that the pizza was very good."

Pizza Local,Very unfriendly reception from waitress on entering. Not suitable for ceoliacs and very expensive charge for a gluten reduced base . Walked out without ordering
Pizza Local,"Local Pizza in Barcelona, in the heart of El Born, stands out for its authentic Neapolitan experience. The quality of the pizzas is excellent, with fresh ingredients that carry the authentic flavors of Italy. The price is adequate for the quality offered, making the culinary experience even more appreciable. The service is efficient, adding value to the visit. Personally, I tried the gluten-free Nduja pizza and was thrilled with the combination of intense flavors and the perfect cooking of the base. I highly recommend Local Pizza to all lovers of real Neapolitan pizza. Excellent Gluten free too!"

Pizza Local,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at a charming pizza restaurant in Barcelona, and it was an experience I wont soon forget. The pizza was, without exaggeration, the best Ive had in a long time. Each slice was a perfect harmony of flavors, with a crust that was just the right mix of crispy and chewy, topped with fresh, high-quality ingredients. But what truly set this dining experience apart was the service. The lady who served us was absolutely amazing. Her warmth and genuine kindness made us feel right at home, and she went out of her way to ensure we had a great time. It was clear she cared deeply about the food and our experience as customers. Our evening was filled with fun, laughter, and, of course, incredible pizza. This restaurant is a must-visit for anyone in Barcelona looking for an unforgettable meal."

Charming space, old interior, and comes decorated. Very good pizzas, one of the best Ive found in BCN, and popular prices. Good friendly and fast service (well, the usual). I have eaten there a few times in the last year, since I met her. Highly recommended."
Pizza Local,Highly recommended!
Pizza Local,"It s a very hip and delicious pizza place. The pizza is cooked right away and comes out quickly and is delicious!! The dough is chewy and delicious. The price is also cheap. The pizza I ordered was what many Koreans order after reading the reviews, and it was spicy and delicious. Also, the staff is quick and all the servers are friendly. And its kind of hip This is a memorable restaurant during my trip to Barcelona."
Pizza Local,"Good food at a reasonable price in a pleasant and very well located place, Carrer de lArgenteria (one of the streets that leads to the literary Cathedral of the Sea, that is, Santa Maria del Mar). Excellent service. Excellent and honest: I was going to order two dishes and the waitress told me (quite gracefully, by the way) that she thought it was too much and that I should order one dish and then, if I was still hungry, another (it was not necessary) and/or a dessert (yes: homemade tiramisu). In short, highly recommended."

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"I visited twice during my trip to Spain. The octopus melts the moment you put it in your mouth. Fried baby squid is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Its a little salty for me, but its delicious. On both visits, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and nice. I also had paella on my first visit, and it was delicious."

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"Super nice and comfortable place in the center, and with more than affordable prices! Friendly, welcoming service and delicious cuisine. The first paella of my life was super positive thanks to the choice of this restaurant. Maybe a little slow in preparation, but I dont actually know how long it takes to prepare this kind of dish. Anyway, highly recommended!"
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"The taste was so good that I visited it twice during my trip to Barcelona. I ate fried squid, paella, and pork belly, and the taste of the food was by far the best. Clara beer was also very tasty and I felt friendly."

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"Return to the Tavern and feel the same cordial, friendly & cool treatment from the waiters! The food is always delicious, we love their menu!! Its people and its environment are very good. A quiet street to chat and rest after a day of shopping downtown!"
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"The food is delicious. I ate paella, octopus, fish, hamburgers, gambas, etc. and it was generally delicious. However, the lamb had too much fat, and the pork ribs were also high in fat, so I didnt recommend it. Ive never tried steak, but I think its similar. In conclusion, if you focus on seafood and paella, excluding meat, I think the average Korean palate will generally like it. Spanish restaurants usually open for lunch at 1pm, but this one opens early. The staff is friendly and there is an English menu. My family came here twice to eat. Recommended for a Gothic Quarter meal."

The staff were the perfect mix of attentive without being overbearing and the kitchen run fantastically with dishes arriving quickly. Its small so I would imagine later on the year a booking would be advised (we visited in January). Definitely one to add to a list of must eat here if you are in Barcelona."

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"I used to be a regular at this place, but I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Some dishes have raised up to a 50%, but they dont reflect the quality of the dishes. The price is what you would find at a good, refined restaurant, not at a fairly basic local restaurant as this one. Also I was served a main course, but the portion was of a starter. Our dishes were overcooked, over fried and cold by the time they arrived. Spending a little more I can go to a good restaurant. I am very sad to lose a local restaurant, but it has become  a tourists trap."
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"Simply Amazing food, good service very happy"
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"A gem in the center of the city. The terrace is quiet, the food is delicious and the waitresses are very nice :)"

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"Went here today. Took a while to take our order. Then food took forever to arrive. It was freezing inside too and took ages to turn the heating in. I ordered the Escalivada with gratin goat cheese and my partner ordered paella. Both were very disappointed with our food. No flavour, cold and dull. I don t know how they have such good ratings, it was drab as hell. Don t go here!"
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"we went in the afternoon after shopping and sat on the pedestrian street, nice food, the children very helpful, important that they spoke English, in a quiet place despite being close to the market."

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"I went to run some errands downtown with my wheelchair handbike. I got hungry and just leaving the Decathlon in Ciutat Vella I found this restaurant. The waitress, Sarah, was very attentive and opened the door for me to enter. I left the handbike at the entrance and he arranged a table for me, perfect for a wheelchair. I was hungry and wanted to eat something quickly, so I took advice. First, Baba Ganush with pita bread and second, beef burger with homemade fries. Everything was excellent. I plan to return and I recommend it not only for the food, but also for the attention and for being an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the center."
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"I came back in February. The first Spanish octopus dish I tried was so soft and delicious.

The refreshing Clara, paella, traditional Catalan liquor and friendly waitress were all perfect."

Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"We came across this Taverneta by chance after an evening walk and decided to have something to eat there. For fish and chips we decided on bread with tomato and a platter of Iberico ham and chorizzo salami. We drank a jug (1.5l) of sangria. Everything tasted very, very tasty! However, the ham and salami seemed a bit expensive for  14. The taste was still very tasty, the service and the ambience were excellent! It was the best fish & chips we have ever eaten! Even though our combination was a bit wild, we would order it that way again"
Restaurant La Taverneta Barcelona,"Tout etait impeccable ! Nous etions 3 et avons pris du poulpe, du saumon et des cote de porc. Et egalement une delicieuse Sangria. Tout etait delicieux et le service etait impeccable. Nous reviendrons sans hesiter lors de notre prochaine visite a Barcelone"

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Good pizza, good atmosphere, super service. Nice place, the aperol spritz type drinks should be improved"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,The place is beautiful...the girls were very friendly and the coffee was spectacular...we also ate a glass sandwich that was delicious
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Its a  meh  chain . It bothers me that they are sold like a big deal but there are hundreds of authentic Italian pizzerias in Barcelona
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,We ordered a takeaway pizza. Very good service: fast and pleasant. Pretty fair pizza. For the price (+ 15) it was not at the level of other pizzerias in the neighborhood.
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Bad service, I orded two pizzas and they missed one and they didnt care at all."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Complete and economical menu!!!
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Great pizza
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Very good pizzas and the desserts are highly recommended.
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Pizzeria Madre Lievito is an Italian restaurant and is a very good alternative to eat in the Passeig de Gracia / Mallorca area. The restaurant is open all day, where you can eat Pizzas, Focazzias and other typical Italian products, all delicious. At noon they offer a full menu for a more than good price, and if you only want Pizza, Drinks and dessert you can also thanks to their option. Upstairs they have an interior room, as well as a table for 8 people, I highly recommend it, it is secluded from the rest and eating there is a top experience. Outside they have a small terrace, it is more for having something quick. The service is excellent, young, friendly and eager staff. The price is good for the area and the quality of the product they offer. You can pay with an Edenred card. I am sure that I will return"

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We couldn t try anything other than pizza; 2 starts only for pizza and normal beer; didnt have many options in the food and drinks, dont know why.. they couldnt give us the right advice because the waiter didnt speak English We waited about 10 minutes for the bill, in the end we didn t receive it and went to pay at the bar, it seemed like the waiter forgot about us, although there were only 2 tables occupied..."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"As an Italian, I can say this is not pizza. Very disappointed really, i live nearby but wont ever order anything there anymore. There is much better choices around. Food"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Acceptable and a little expensive, I went to have a drink and it seemed very fair to me that what we ordered took a while for them to come and give us the change."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Ive never had a pizza like this before, a pizza raw on the inside and completely burnt on the top and bottom. The ambience is really nice. The prices are high. My Diavolo pizza had about 5 grams of salami."

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,The cardboard was tasty but the dough was not recycled.

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"The worst garbage I have ever eaten in my life, I dont think I would eat it even if I were a participant in the snow society."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Food: I ordered a carbonara pizza. Dry pizza, dry cheese, they didnt have original guancciale, it was excessively salty. Service: Fatal, the waitress made mistakes with all the drinks and did not work with pleasure. I asked him to recommend me between two dishes and he didnt say anything waiting for my decision. Then, when serving the drinks and noticing his lack of experience, he spilled a glass of red wine on me, it was terrible because it actually happened due to malpractice. At the restaurant they did not apologize and did not offer anything in exchange for the inconvenience. Normally, with an accident like this, so that you dont feel so sad, they usually give you some love, a discount or something to cheer you up, but I had a bad time. In speaking to the people at checkout they have been really curt about the situation, saying you just have to wash them and its no big deal. The truth is that it seemed like a terrible deal to me. Atmosphere: No atmosphere I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SITE"

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We all ordered pizza and they were all delicious, they have many types. I had the one with stracciatella and pesto, very rich in flavor, despite being a little too salty due to the pesto. My sparkling water was  degassed  (as if it had been evaporated) Despite this, very good quality/price! 17.5 with 2 waters and a pizza."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"My favorite Italian in Barcelona! Casual atmosphere with the best Italian food Ive had in the city.

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"The restaurant has a full menu, half menu or a la carte service. Market prices. Fast service. Attentive staff. Extra-large and well-seasoned pizzas. You can eat on the terrace, at the bar or on the first floor at cozy tables. Parking: Difficult to park on the street but there are several parking spaces nearby Kid-friendliness: It is not advisable to go with children because they do not have free space to move Wheelchair accessibility: There is no problem on the terrace, but it is not accessible to the first floor"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Not to go expressly, but if it matches you, its not bad. You eat well and not very expensive."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Awful!!! Pizzas that came out cold, others burnt and the most amazing thing is that they were all chewing gum... Never again... There are a thousand better places in Barcelona."

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We ordered delivery through Globo for a two for 1 offer, we only received one pizza (quite cold by the way) and a certain Rich from the Globo assistance service has not helped us, it seems more like they are taking you for a ride. by.globos support chat...The.quality has gone down a lot now.we do not recommend it..."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We had dinner by chance without any reservation in the middle of December, I must say that it is one of the worst pizzas we have ever had in our lives. The salad was also horrible. The staff treatment has been good and so has the atmosphere. We muddled through since we had nowhere to eat but we wont be back when were in Barcelona."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Good Neapolitan pizza with decent prices. Of course, all in Spanish. No respect for being a restaurant located in Catalonia. We will not go back."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Pizza had a nice flavour but base was burnt and mushy. Atmosphere non-existent and service beyond poor! Far better to visit in Barcelona
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Everything was excellent, we enjoyed the food and the service. We will return without a doubt! The waiter a 10 and the pizzas another 10! Many thanks for everything!"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We had seafood paella, pasta, tapas and pizza. Food was very good and the service also! Kid-friendliness: Waiters are very friendly and talk to kids also."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"They sent my order wrong, and mixed salad with Milanese, so the salad arrived all wet and hot"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Real Italian pizzeria. Friendly and prepared staff. We tasted the pizzas. Excellent. Low prices for Barcelona. We will be back.
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Boxing Day. Inside there were only three full tables. They make us wait an hour and the pizzas that arrive are like this. Pizza? I would say no. Not even an apology for the delay, a discount, nothing. We had to point it out to him. If they want to give priority to take-away pizzas, then they should close the restaurant."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Our favourite pizzeria in Barcelona        very tasty ! And very nice service
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Magnificent food with a wealth of good service and friendliness
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We were a group of 10 people and it seemed like a real disappointment. The pizzas were bubblegum, low quality ingredients in general. The eggplant parmigiana did not have a good flavor and was very heavy. Not to mention the wine, both the white and the red that they offer you, both very bad. We love Italian wine but this one was not good at all. (We attach one of the pizzas we have ordered)"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"I placed an order on 12/12/2023 at 11:10 p.m. via Uber, and WITHOUT the delivery man being late, they came frozen, two very small pizzas, without buffalo or basil, they practically made fun of me. It seems that the typical Italian, who thinks he is very alive, wanted to laugh in my face. I put it on Google because the person who did this is a scoundrel."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"I was told that it was the best pizzeria in Barcelona, so I had high expectations. Well, in the end I dont have the same opinion as others. The place is very nice and the service is very good but in my opinion there are other better places."

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We stopped here for lunch as we wanted authentic Italian food. I had lasagne which was probably the best I have ever had .. superb! Others had pizza which was lovely, and the pasta carbonara and bolognese were delicious also."

Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"For a Brazilian tourist, the pizza was great, I liked the place, the time it opens also, I had thought of going somewhere else next to my hotel, so this was my second choice but I had a good experience. The only detail that made me give 4 stars to the service is that Im an old fashioned person, Im not a fan of QR Codes for ordering and etc, and the fact I had to go downstairs to make my order, or maybe Im too used to Brazilian service. But its really great and Id definitely recommend it to others."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"As an Italian and Neapolitan, I say that I ate really well and had good service."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We ordered some bufalina pizzas to take away with Uber eats. Other pizzas (bufalinas and cherry) arrived very, very burnt. We had to throw away more than half and they ruined our dinner. I understand that it is a Saturday and that maybe they have a lot of work but I dont know how they can deliver pizzas like that, Im sorry. Never more."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We have ordered two bufalinas and we have received other pizzas and they were also burnt, horrible experience, I dont know how they could eat"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"Bad bad bad. I had been to Madre Yeast in Poble Noi years ago and I remember an overall pleasant experience. In this example pizzeria the pizzas are not up to par. Indefinite mass, it is not a Neapolitan pizza but not even a Roman one, almost non-existent tomato sauce, burnt edges, tasteless pizzas"
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Overrated pizzas but not bad at all.
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,The service is fast. The calm atmosphere. And what we tried was delicious.
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,"We were looking for somewhere to eat and everything was closed at 6! That s when we learned about what people mean when they say Spanish dinner. Anyways, we found this place and was pretty good pizza. We had both the margherita and provolone. And while both look the same, they were different. Margherita is more tomato and cheese, and provolone is more pepper/spice and cheese. Both were great options if you re looking for a quickly snack."
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,A good place to eat pizza
Madre Lievito Eixample - Pizzeria & Trattoria | Restaurante,Delicious. One point minus just because second time wasnt as nice waiter... he looks like he wants us to leave as quickly as possible...
El Caliu del Poblenou,"3 fingers of vermouth, the very small and reheated bravas are not made immediately, the sauce was good, they just added little. The calamari came in 5, with hardly any flavor  the waiter was very nice."
El Caliu del Poblenou,Dont even think about coming to this place. I order a beer and half of it was foam. It cost me 3.5 fucking Euros and they dont accept cards. Painful.
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Terrible service! The manager looks like an angry mob guy, to avoid!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We really enjoyed our experience tonight. The food was amazing, the service and atmosphere as well."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Very nice and aesthetically pleasing place inside. You are also enticed to enter because of the type and prices of the dishes offered. Unfortunately we realized that the prices are low for food but high for drinks which are not indicated on the menus. We ordered a sangria (which we then paid for in full and did not consume as it was nauseatingly sweet. A mix of sugar, orangeade, lemonade and a little wine. The only fruit present was the orange) 6.50 an average of beer (these days never paid more than 4 euros). The food was nothing special and very greasy. The only positive note was the waiter who served us, very kind and polite, the 3 stars only thanks to him. I would also add that our children who needed the bathroom refused to go because they were dirty."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"This was a delight! Great atmosphere. Brie and prawns with tomato bread to start were lovely and great portion sizes. Followed by absolutely delicious pork with blue cheese sauce and lamb with aioli, both delicious. Would recommend."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Very good food, especially the hamburger and patatas bravas, very friendly staff; To try!!!!!!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Staff really helpful and kind. The food was excellent and the place was welcoming, highly recommended."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Some thieves. 6.50 a draft beer. I live in Barcelona and I know the prices. The price is really exaggerated. They also do not accept paying less than  10 by card, only."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Im not crazy about Catalan cuisine, but I must say that I found it better than in other places. With friends we had a mixed round of tapas with which we ate our fill. The wine selection is also excellent!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,Vegetarian options: Paellas vegetarianas con muy buen sabor Food
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,Terrible quantity-price ratio
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,We ordered the brie filled with honey and Andalusian-style squid. Very little food and high prices. The rod 3.5. The location is nice
El Caliu del Poblenou,I missed the letter in Catalan! There are still establishments that do not realize how important it is to respect ones own language
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,Very nice service and great food
El Caliu del Poblenou,It is extremely expensive for the service and the scarcity of the Tapas! Kid-friendliness: They only allow entry. They dont have special chairs or changing tables in the bathroom!
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We had guests from France, one is a chef in his own restaurant.  So hm!!! where to take them for a Catalan experience, we selected Caliu, even though we had not been  before. It was a convenient location for all. The experience was great, our guests had Seafood Paella   and they were extremely happy. The other meals were the duck and fish, both were great. We made the mistake of not ordering as salad initially as the meals came with potato only. That s fine as a salad was quickly provided. The wine selection was varied, and we are wine folk. We ordered an expensive, but excellent Catalan wine to go with the meals (this was decanted  ) but cheaper wines were available. There was a good selection of delicious postres. The service was excellent and attentive with being smothering. It was a rainy/windy night with few customers, at the early sitting we had, but still glad we had reserved. Over all a great night, we will be back."
El Caliu del Poblenou,Delicious fresh food. Welcoming and friendly service and perfect service. Recommended!
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Five fries on a cross, a dollop of some sauce, failure. Two stars for the outdoor atmosphere. I certainly wont come back."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The only good thing about the bar is the waiter, the poor guy is very polite and correct. The price is expensive for what you eat, see attached photos, the photo does not show the squid that we ordered grilled, because they were served with sauce and without cleaning, inedible!!!!!! The broken eggs with bravas potatoes and the hard yrmaa, so...imagine. And as for the courthouse beer, the price is  4.25 for a glass. The bread two scant slices. I do not recommend this site at all!!!!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We didnt read the other reviews, encouraged to enter by the welcoming location, big mistake! Trap for tourists. In our case, embarrassing food to say the least. Patatas Bravas not special and with very little sauce. Small, dry baked golden brown and with a side dish consisting of two dried potatoes. Grilled tuna too dry and tasteless, served without lemon, salad not fresh. If I have to spend more than 50 euros I expect to at least eat decently! Experience not to be repeated!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"They ask if you want for exemple bread and then charge unreasonable much for it. One of us order one beer and the came with 3, and charged quite high for it. Do not recommend. Turisttrap"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Good place to taste tapas, toasts. Right price. Good quality of food. The portions are a bit small."
El Caliu del Poblenou,I loved the treatment of the staff and the very delicious bravas. Value for money is very good
El Caliu del Poblenou,"A STEAL, the portions are miserable, the drinks are very expensive. To that we must add a  2.90 supplement for eating on the terrace. I dont recommend it at all"
El Caliu del Poblenou,I love it! Greetings from Hamburg!
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The most unfortunate thing that has happened to me in years, a waiter who does not know the menu, who brings you the drinks after waiting for a long time, the beer if it is not a half-liter jug they will not serve it to you, five of the diners We had finished our dishes and the sixth had not started, we asked for bread and they brought us four slices with tomato, we told them that we did not order it with tomato and they answered that there is no more bread, scarce and cold dishes, we ordered the wine four times There was no dessert, in short, everything was terrible."
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Absurdly slow service, tiny portions. They run out of food and dont give notice. A major disaster."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Really disappointing. A slow, uninterested service (he talks on his cell phone while serving!?!) made the boy wait more than an hour to bring his food. - we had to go look for it in the kitchen! Small portions and one over valued in price. A bad choice that we will certainly not repeat."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The slice of squid at  1.45 is undoubtedly a great culinary experience. The best is the portion of bread with tomato, they put two because one would look very lonely."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Delicious dinner tonight. Friendly staff. Food very flavorful and great recommendation on appetizers from the staff. Roasted vegetables (escalidaba con queso), tomato bread (pan con tomate) chicken with potatoes and salad (pe hugs de pollo) macarrones bolognese and house wine. Definitely recommend giving them your business."
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The service is terrible, even dramatic, waiters mix up tables, mix up orders, lose cutlery along the way. They dont know after 5 minutes how many people ordered food. One waiter takes an order for 3 people and another brings cutlery for 5. Catastrophe. Everything was terrible - drinks, service, organization. Never again. I do not recommend. I advise against it. The worst place Ive ever been to because I had to wait a long time for the bill."
El Caliu del Poblenou,The best dinner in 4 days in Barcelona Very nice place and very friendly staff
El Caliu del Poblenou,Petit resto sympathique dans le quartier poblenou menu a prix abordable on y decouvre des tapas c est bon je recommande.
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"I do not recommend to anybody. Very expensive and not good at all. There are many other better places on the Rambla de PobleNou. In fact, almost all of them... Im telling you a neighbor from the neighborhood..."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"What a great find! We shared a tapas platter, the food was delicious and the service great. Would definitely recommend"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We came for dinner in our first night in Barcelona. And the food was delicious, the paella was amazing."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"A perfect place for dinner, delicious food and spectacular service from the waiter, I give it a 10/10."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The price of the food did not correspond to the quantity (a portion of tapas for 3 people per person PLN 21.95 was a portion for one person, the minimum order was for 2 people), fries drowned in fat, shrimps burned, waiting time very long, food and drink prices very high . Service not interested in the customer. I highly do not recommend it. We left the pub hungry.... I highly do not recommend."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Very VERY small portions, very friendly service, but also very slow. The quality-price ratio is quite unfortunate. Im very sorry, but I dont recommend it."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Tables and chairs invade public roads, going well beyond the limits. Taking away a lot of space from pedestrians so that your customers are super wide."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Wonderful service, great ambiance along delicious tapas.  It was a very reasonably priced"
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,The duck was amazing and we had the best patatas bravas we ve had so far! Good portions and reasonably priced!
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Brilliant service. The food was very nice, portions could be bigger, but the the waiter gave excellent advice and made up for it!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Coming from Australia, this is one of the best restaurants we have been too in barca, top tier food and service would definitely recommend for everyone!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,Good food and good service
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We ate today at Caliu, the food was very delicious, and the service was very pleasant, with good service and speed. Highly recommended!!!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"My lady and I were lucky enough to be in Barcelona for a few days in October and we stumbled upon this marvelous little place. The first night we went in, Im pretty sure we were there only ones in there although it was very early for an evening meal! We wanted to make sure we ate something reasonably local and El Caliu definitely fit the bill. We had 6 different tapas dishes between 2 of us and were very satisfied with the sizes. The quality of the dishes was exceptional to the point we came back the next night too! My lady said the creme brulee was the best shed ever eaten. For all this and beers a plenty the cost of around  70 was great value. The service was very friendly and attentive and our host even made recommendations. Will be back next time were here. Fantastic."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"A super nice, cozy place, good food and charming service"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We went to dinner on the recommendation of a friend and once again it was demonstrated that the power of both constructive and destructive reviews is always unshadowed by your experience. Which turned out to be an excellent meal, with service from perfectly friendly waiters and everything wrapped up. for a very cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended gastronomic option for service, price and quality."
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,Patatas bravas 100% amazing men who speak english so very good for tourist very nice Wheelchair accessibility: Very access
El Caliu del Poblenou,YUMMMY
El Caliu del Poblenou,Fantastic food and atmosphere - the patatas bravas were amazing!
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Tourist trap, absolutely to be avoided: average service, very average tapas and the worst is the discovery of a terraza supplement of 11  on the bill. Unheard of for a BCN regular for 20 years Disappointed and saddened to have experienced this."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We had dinner for 4 on the terrace and we ordered Sole, Cod, Butifarra and Entrecote. Everything was very good and to the point. Price in line with quality and service. Interior with exquisite decoration and very cozy. Friendly and efficient service. Recommended.......We will return!!!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Very good food, served very quickly. Very well taken care of. Delicious macaroni bolognese. And very good sausage with aioli."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Eat well. To highlight the friendliness of Victor, the waiter"
El Caliu del Poblenou,Great stop
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We paid  4.5 for each medium beer. They told us that they didnt have draft beer, only jugs, but in reality they dont feel like serving it to you. A fraud."
El Caliu del Poblenou,I really like patatas bravas!!
El Caliu del Poblenou,Awesome service. Great vibe. Rustic atmosphere. I enjoyed it a lot   amazing
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Tourist trap all the way, expensive food and beers. Also they do not let you pay with card if it s less than 10"
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,The guy who served us was magnificent. Professional and very friendly. Food. Divine. I will recommend it with great pleasure.
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Only suitable for tourists and those who are half-ready because with what they charge you and the friendliness they exude, you have to be very stupid to sit there. Unfortunately, I crashed. More expensive beer than on Paseo de Gracia (4.25), served by a plate carrier who has no idea what it is to be a waiter and who is also a life-forgiver. Vulgar food with small portions, ideal to use as a hook to catch you and smack you with the drink. Restaurant (?) misleading. Laughable! One piece of advice: dont even come close!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The food is very delicious!! Very attentive and kind who assisted me, thank you for your kindness!!!! I will return without a doubt"
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Salmon full of bones, very small, ugly piece. About a third as big as usual for the price. Price-performance ratio below average. Service is nice, but can take a while."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"VERY EXPENSIVE and the waiter was somewhat rude. We went to have a drink, the terrace was empty, they forced us to consume ALL drinks (there was a girl who didnt want to) and we had also ordered some bravas. The clear one  7 and the water  3.5 The potatoes are good but scarce, very small."
El Caliu del Poblenou,The food is not bad but the portions are fairly fair. The croquettes literally come in 3. The somewhat expensive drink: a red summer in a glass of wine  6.5
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Not recommended. Very fair and expensive food for the price, in fact the oil in the potatoes seems very rancid. If you look at the price on the menu it seems like its not bad but surprise when paying... beers over  4, slice of bread at  1.25... the only saving grace is that the waiter was friendly."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We ordered tapas to dine inside, good atmosphere, good food but small portions."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"The best tapas in Barcelona. This place never fails. Recommended the brie in tempura with honey  The attention, the place, everything perfect. Thank you for always being super attentive!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,Dishes with little quantity.
El Caliu del Poblenou,Nice people but 3.5 for sparkling water without being fresh
El Caliu del Poblenou,"A scam... cheats with normal food prices to charge crazy prices for drinks. I had never paid 6.5 for a red summer wine and 4.95 for a vermouth (in a small glass with ice). The food is not worth it and the service leaves a lot to be desired, it is easy to get into an argument if you ask a price."
El Caliu del Poblenou,Mediocre food for quite a high price compared to other restaurants... wouldnt go there second time. Are better addresses in the same street.
El Caliu del Poblenou,
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Literally, delicious and homemade food, for my partner and me, it is the best restaurant on the Rambla de Poblenou, we ordered bread with tomato as a starter and for dinner, some bolognese macaroni and potatoes with egg and ham, and it had all the homemade flavor Overall, it has undoubtedly left us wanting more, and ordering dessert this time."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"Les calamars grilles etaient tres savoureux, merci!!!"
El Caliu del Poblenou,Too much expensive!! Small tapas Only 3  meatball  and  potatos 10  .. 1 beer 0;5 L 6;50 .. Roman style squid only 4 pieces around 8 No ask about size off beer they put Big one...
El Caliu del Poblenou,Dont even pass it! An armed robbery! 2 glasses of beer  8.50 and hot on top of that!!
El Caliu del Poblenou,"One of the worst on the Rambla del PobleNou. I dont need to say anything... Everything is in the reviews of other previous clients. Its true: very expensive and very unfriendly. For tourists, locals: dont go."
El Caliu del Poblenou,"We sat on the terrace for dinner. They advertise themselves as a tapas and toast bar. We wanted to order portions for dinner but they told us that they dont serve portions, that it has to be one plate each . May it go well..."
El Caliu del Poblenou,Very unpleasant. I will not come back
El Caliu del Poblenou,A tapas bar where you sit on the terrace and they dont let you order tapas. With this everything is said. Now I understand the note you have

Frankfurt Diagonal,The Frankfurt of a lifetime
Frankfurt Diagonal,

Frankfurt Diagonal,"Excellent sandwiches, perfect place to eat if you are hungry with a good variety of beers   ...in front of the shopping center, without a doubt for me it is better to eat here before entering ...and good service!!"

Royal Nepal,"Excellent restaurant with Indian and Nepalese food. I go very often and I highly recommend it, the service is a 10 and the food is very good, as well as serving quickly. Recommended dishes: chicken tikka masala and chicken curry. The price is very good, about  10-15 per person."

Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,"Upon entering the restaurant you can already perceive a very pleasant atmosphere, the place feels cozy. Music and calm atmosphere. The attention from the waitress was very good, she didnt speak much Spanish but she understood perfectly what we wanted and was always attentive to what we needed. The food is very good!!! I dont understand people who leave 1 between them. I will definitely return!"
Royal Nepal,"Great restaurant! Very very good food, with original dishes that also show that they are homemade. They have many 100% gluten-free dishes suitable for celiacs and a daily menu at a very good price. We will repeat!"
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,"EXQUISIT. Indian/nepali style homemade food. Very recommended for tourists who come to the Sagrada Familia. Is just behind 1 minute walk. Mid-week menu costs 13,50  and you can choose between 3 first plates (for eg. Pakhora, soup,  ) and 3 seconds (chicken curry, fish, spicy pork, dhal ) + desert and one drink. All this included. They also bring you a crispy snack with 3 sauces (mint, mango and spicy) rice and naan! The soup was excellent! The curry very tasty. The service is so kind and gentle as the nepalies are. The place is comfortable and cozy. People should come definitely and support places like this. Parking: Theres many private parkings just at the corner."
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,"Was visiting the sagrida da familia and searched online for Indian/Asian restaurants nearby as I was in the mood for something spicy. Decided to give this place a go. We were shown to a table and browsed the menu.... typically I choose jalfrezi when eating indian food and asked which dish would be similar. The waitress told me that the chef will cook jalfrezi if I wanted it, even though it wasnt on the menu. And that gesture sums up my visit here , nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff here. Lovely food, nice area,and reasonably priced. Ill be sure to call in on my next trip to Barcelona. Thanks"
Royal Nepal,"Delicious food, reasonable prices, friendly attitude"
Royal Nepal,The burrito is delicious Chicken curry sauce is delicious Highly recommended

Royal Nepal,We found the place cozy and the guy who served us very nice. The food is good and at the right price.
Royal Nepal,"A great Nepalese restaurant offering a wide variety of classic Nepalese/Indian dishes for very good prices. The restaurant has beautiful interiors with many tables. The staff is very friendly, polite and fast. The food tastes very authentic, it is balanced and well seasoned. The portions are just right. If you order naan, you will get four big pieces. I was very satisfied. Everything was perfect! Vegetarian options: They have many vegetarian options."

Royal Nepal,"The place is very spacious, well decorated/decorated, the staff friendly. The food is very delicious, abundant and with affordable prices."
Royal Nepal,"We went to eat here through the folk app, which had a 30% discount, without having any idea what we were going to eat and what the place, the service, etc., would be like. And what a surprise, the food is exquisite, they have everything marked for celiacs on the menu, the waiters service was very friendly, they brought us all the food together, so we could all enjoy it together!! Be careful when it says spicy, it really is spicy!!! Congratulations   I would return without hesitation. We paid around  16 each"
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,"The food is really good and authentic. The price is very reasonable. We made a reservation through TheFork, which offered 30% off coupon. I had not expected the coupon would work as its condition is confusing. I did not even bother to ask about the promotion. To my surprise, the restaurant directly applied 30% off coupon to the bill except the drinks which were excluded from the promotion. I respect their honesty in doing business."
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,"A must-see in the neighborhood. Good food, good service and very good prices. The place where we take everyone who visits us. 100% recommendable."

Royal Nepal,You should try!
Royal Nepal,"We had dinner here last night! Went with momos, chicken wings, Thupka and Chowmein. The food was nice overall and we really enjoyed our dinner. The service was fast and the ambience was good too. The only thing average I found was chicken wings. They were a bit dry. Overall highly recommended."
Royal Nepal,"Went with my children, it is a lovely, cozy place. Full was delicious. They had options that were not spicy as my children do not eat spicy. Everything was delicious!!"
Royal Nepal,"Great experience at Royal Nepal with a vast menu of food and all the healthy and tasty options. Visited them frequently during my trip to Barcelona. Overall, highly recommended restaurant to taste vegetarian to non vegetarian dishes such as bhaat, soups and coffee."
Royal Nepal,Had the menu with the starters+main course+dessert. Was surprisingly very good. Food
Royal Nepal,The service is a scam. They promised us a discount for the fork app that they later did not apply to us.
Royal Nepal,Good quality-price. There is usually plenty of space and the tables are quite far apart so it is pleasant to eat inside. Try the soup!
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,Exquisite everything and great attention
Royal Nepal,Moms vegetables
Royal Nepal,"The site is very good, if you take it with the fork it is very cheap and is great. The dishes are very filling and delicious. Kid-friendliness: I went with my 1-month-old baby and they didnt have any problems, we were able to have the stroller next to the table without problems."
Royal Nepal,Super recommended!

Royal Nepal,"What a throwback to a typical South Asian restaurant in the middle of stylish Barcelona! They ve tried hard to keep the space reminiscent of Nepal - complete with Annapurna posters, image of Laxmi and Nepalese pop playing on TV. Even the table decor is so Nepalese, as are the friendly waiters. The food is a hit or miss for somebody who knows a bit about the Himalayan cuisines. Between butter chicken (kids insisted, and was an absolute miss), to Indian Chinese style egg noodles (made with pasta), the clue is the stick with traditional Nepali dishes. But I have to give a double shoutout to the  Khaja Thali  which was a combination of several Nepalese tapas - oh so spicy, flavors and spot on with the textures. I highly recommend this dish for patrons who value the effort that goes into making each of the starters in this thali. It s not an entree but it s such a fusion of tapas loving culture with representative Nepalese small plates."
Royal Nepal,"We went for dinner as a group on a Saturday night, we had booked a few days before so there was no problem arriving. The attention was very correct, we did not lack anything at any time and they were attentive all the time. As for the food, I found it very tasty and rich. Curious to see programs on TV that I suppose originate from your land. To keep in mind if Im looking to eat Nepalese/Indian in the neighborhood near Sagrada Familia."
Royal Nepal,Looking for a local restaurant near our hotel we came upon the Royal Nepal Restaurant in Barcelona. They offered a great menu and we selected the tasting option which was plentiful ( for two) and absolutely delicious. Price was very reasonable and we couldn t finish everything in front of us.  If you have the chance stop by this hidden gem in Barcelona near the Sagrada Familia.
Royal Nepal,Good food and service. Delicious Momo.

Royal Nepal,"Let me be clear on one fact: you eat well here, ok? Not one dish that I dont want to meet my taste buds to party. Anyway, so there I was,  just started to sip on a nestea and BOOM. The madras and curry  train made a stop at our table faster than a student doing homework while the teacher is collecting it. And let me tell you, when the munchies hit your tongue, its heaven. Most of the goodies have a moderate spice, which is kinda the cherry on top already, considering the place is pretty much, how do I say it? Oh ya, GOATED. And the place looks like a palace, so +1 point."
Royal Nepal,
Royal Nepal,I like food n services

Royal Nepal,"Charming Nepali restaurant near the Sagrada Familia. Good service and very delicious food!!!    We ordered the  25 tasting menu to try a little of everything with samosas, chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry,... you wont leave hungry. The drinks come separately and they have Cobra"
Royal Nepal,"A good place to eat Nepalese food. The place is nice and so is the service. The Ginger chicken, The chicken curry madras (spicy) were to die for. The samosas, garlic, whole wheat and cheese pancakes are very good. Good price."

Royal Nepal,"Nice place with a good atmosphere to eat relaxed and with family, excellent staff and great food at a very good price. My sister and my brother-in-law live nearby and go almost every day because there are few places in the Sagrada Familia area so there are no tourists. Highly recommended!"
Royal Nepal,"We did the tasting menu, good food and the correct portions."
Royal Nepal,Very good and tasty. Very competitive prices.
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,It was a good experience and very much variation of food. The staff is also friendly and helpful. I recommend it to everyone.
Passeig 9,"Our group of 8 Americans, with very little skill in Spanish, wandered in one evening and had a wonderful experience.  Unlike many of the other restaurants in the area that are loud, noisy and have outdoor seating, this was small and quaint with only 7-8 tables.  It appeared that the owner and the chef were the only ones working that night and the owner was accommodating and charming.  The tapas and desserts we shared were wonderful and the prices were very reasonable.  So may restaurants to chose from in Barcelona but Id have no problem going there again for another meal. Vegetarian options: Many veggie tapas to chose from"
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"From Colombia we came to try the PASSEOG9 proposal, upon arriving we found a cozy decoration and wonderful reception from the staff, we tried seafood paella and the 4 cheese pasta, which is the first time I have tasted it. Spectacular experience"
Passeig 9,The food is delicious and the service is spectacular
Passeig 9,Wonderful experience.   Great variety of tapas.  Food was great!  Staff was very accommodating to US group.
Passeig 9,"We visited Barcelona and LOVED this restaurant!! The food, service, music and atmosphere was just outstanding. ViSit this restaurant and you will be so impressed!"
Passeig 9,I had the worts tiramisu in all over the world. Overall expensive and tasteless food
Passeig 9,"They have a terrace but they take forever to serve. If they open a terrace, you have to pay attention guys."
Passeig 9,the most expensive vermouth/beer in history
Passeig 9,"Nice place Highly recommended, good service."
Passeig 9,"Nice atmosphere, the tapas were super tasty. The waiter very nice."
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Im not giving you 5 stars, because the dessert took a while to come and we had to go see what was happening, but otherwise, good and very quiet, although it was Monday noon, of course."
Passeig 9,"Wonderful atmospheric place. The food is very tasty, the waiters were kind and attentive. I recommend it! Food : 5/5"
Passeig 9,"Very bad. The place is not very nice but the food is terrible. Its not at the level it charges, no kidding. Any  12 menu is infinitely better"
Passeig 9,"Terrible. The warm price is unbalanced, bad food and very high price. Unpleasant treatment and very cold. Not recommendable."
Passeig 9,"Unfriendly service or owner, if you just want a drink you should leave quickly. For a small salad you charge  10.50. For a sangria 22 , although 2 steps further it costs 13.50 . Sangria had no fruit and little wine. Its cleaned up before youre done. Its more likely to work with the stitch, if you dont want to eat a lot, then its better to leave. So its better to eat somewhere else. 1 star too many, -10"
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"It scored a 1 because it wont let me put a 0. I ordered white wine and they brought me the glass served without seeing the bottle (it was cardboard wine). The garlic prawns were a bowl with 5 counted peeled prawns and came cooked without oil, the only thing you could see was the water from the thawed prawns. The cod main dish came on some cooked potatoes, some hot and some cold (bad with the microwave) and the cod was bathed in mayonnaise. And the sole dish was the simplest sole in history...fried even with the head and without sauce or salt. After spending  74 the only thing I remember is the foul belching left over from the meal."
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"The name is deceiving, abusive prices, terrible quality and a menu focused on tourist clientele who know they wont come back. As an example: we were charged 4 euros for a Coca Cola and 6 for a glass of white wine that looked like vinegar. A scam in every letter."
Passeig 9,"Friendly service and a nice place, but they are very crazy about the prices (small vermouth  5.25)."
Passeig 9,The worst in the neighborhood
Passeig 9,"Food was appalling. Incredibly overpriced and most definitely not worth it. I was not happy with the customer service, not very polite and charged me and my friend to sit outside without consulting beforehand. We were approached by a member of staff who removed all table decorations when we sat there and put onto another table which ruined the atmosphere for us and overall I wouldn t recommend coming here."
Passeig 9,"PLEASE DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT This was genuinely one of the most depressing meals that I have ever eaten. Ive never left a review on Google of any place Ive been to but the food here was so poor that it caused offense. Ill get this out of the way first as it isnt to do with the food but its important to mention that the pricing is misleading when its mentioned as for two people. Dont allow yourself to get scammed by this. Secondly the food. The waiter recommended we had some grilled octopus for the table. This was a monstrosity. I had one bite in which I spent five minutes attempting to make my way through the toughness and which if I hadnt been sat with friends would have spat out in a napkin and tossed in the bin. It was so oily that the oil from the octopus ran off the plate and on to the table in which I had to wipe it up with a napkin to stop it spilling off onto my trousers. For my main I had the monkfish stew which was the most appalling over cooked piece of seafood I have ever eaten. Worst of all it didnt taste of anything surrounded in what I can only describe as some hot water with a hint of tomato flavouring. Youll get more flavour in pot noodle for  1 than this disgrace costing nearly  17. Its Barcelona, a city by the sea, its beyond compression that there could be a place in the city serving seafood this bad. For the rest of stew there was a couple of sad chunks of potato, clams and a prawn which I didnt touch based off the experience with the monkfish. Only a fool would go any further after eating anything this bad. If you decide to eat here after reading this then you only have yourself to blame. Please dont."
Passeig 9,Everything super delicious!!
Passeig 9,"Very high prices, no transparency as they do not have a menu for the drinks when asked"
Passeig 9,Tourist trap !!!! Steer far away..
Passeig 9,Very nice people and the patatas bravas were very well made.
Passeig 9,Very rich!
Passeig 9,Very good service
Passeig 9,"Very rich and delicious, the people are incredible"
Passeig 9,Very rich
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,Incredible time here
Passeig 9,Excellent atention!
Passeig 9,Bad and expensive. Glass of bad house wine  5.75 not worth it not the whole bottle
Passeig 9,"Ridiculous portions, inflated price, terrible quality... in short, a restaurant scam"
Passeig 9,Uncooked food Higher prices on the final note
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"25 euros 2 vermouth, some olives and 2 Vichy. Avoid this site. Very expensive, its not worth it. Very dirty too"
Passeig 9,Very expensive Bad relationship between staff and boss It is hot inside and poorly conditioned. Bad smell... Not kid friendly. I came out with oil stained clothes... clumsiness of the service. They didnt have stain removers.
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,Everything is super good
Passeig 9,"Food is good, but a little bit more expensive then in the nier by restaurants."
Passeig 9,"Avoid this place! Cheat with a portion, order a plate for  20, and on the bill  40 supposedly double portion! In the nearby restaurants on this street, you for these same dishes order twice cheaper!"
Passeig 9,"Keep walking, run away, dont waste time"
Passeig 9,Avoid completely!! Its a tourist trap!! Be careful with the prices at the end they charge you several additional items that are not reported anywhere!
Passeig 9,"9,15  for an  Aperol Spritz  which actually contain Fanta. Don t go."
Passeig 9,"I have a degree in Food Chemistry. And a food critic. I congratulate the owner and his staff. From Passeig 9. I have TRIED the Pastas, the meats and the salads. And I can assure you that at El Restaurante Passeig 9. they will eat 10. VERY Satisfied AND ENJOY IN A VERY WELCOMING PREMISES."
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"More than sharing my experience, I want to warn potential clients that the place is a real shame. Beer can only be in half-liter jugs (yes or yes) and they dont have bottles either, so you either finish it hot, which is easy at this temperature, or leave it alone. Price. 6  60 We ate three portions: Salad; or what is the same, half a bag of packaged salad from the supermarket with ONE cherry tomato cut in two, and ONE olive cut into four pieces. Price  9.90 Andalusian-style squid: FIVE (that is, one squid) slices of squid, and small. Price  10.45 A serving of Padron peppers, about 10 or 12 peppers. Price  8.25 Ahhh and four small pieces of bread with tomato. Price  4.20 Lets go what I consider a real scam. So be careful if you go through Poblenou, be careful with this place."
Passeig 9,"A fuir ! Les prix affiches sur la carte ne correspondent pas aux prix payes, il y a 2     Par plat en + que sur la carte. Extremement cher pour la qualite et la quantite, une arnaque ! Je ne recommande pas du tout"
Passeig 9,"The place is nice inside with its rustic style, the gastronomic proposal is good but it does not stand out compared to surrounding places, not to mention the super high prices for the dishes. It is true it is a tourist area. the service very attentive 7/10"
Passeig 9,"To get the money out of money orders, they wont see the fur in my life. The beer must be large (canes or averages are not served).  6.6 They also dont serve coffee unless you eat at the bar, even if its 5pm and theres no one on the terrace or inside the bar..."
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Fantastic food in a wonderful restaurant,  staff were lovely and friendly,  will be back again."
Passeig 9,The food was good but ordered a menu and paid 2 prices confusing vie too much a menu of meat dishes 55  not to be missed
Passeig 9,"Disastrous. Very expensive, the tapas portions are minimal in quantity and quality, but the worst of all is the state of the food they serve you. I dont think it passed a health check. Local to avoid in our opinion."
Passeig 9,Food is very good. Ok prices. Good service
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Today, a weekday, a friend and I had a jug of beer, which had to be 500cl and a Free Damm, and for these two drinks they charged us  10.45. It seems very good to me that tourism is promoted and that they want to take advantage, but these prices? Its sad, Im from the neighborhood and I can no longer have a sad drink without it costing a fortune P.S. Curiously, the terrace was empty."
Passeig 9,Trop cher pour des plats basiques et bas de gammes.
Passeig 9,They told us that they wouldnt serve us coffee on the terrace if we didnt have lunch. It was 5pm!
Passeig 9,"TOURIST TRAP!!! Totally inadvisable, the prices are totally abusive. Restaurant of dubious quality and excessively high prices. The city council should regulate this type of establishment and withdraw its license."
Passeig 9,"Empty tables, we sit down, order a couple of tapas and two wines and they tell us that if its just that we cant be there. Lets go... first time Ive seen something similar... totally inadvisable to go"
Passeig 9,A glass of wine for 5 euro! What?!
Passeig 9,We had good experience when we dined here. We wanted to try tapas (vegetarian) and we werent dismayed. Good thing we didnt order more food as the tapas and salad were more than enough. LOL! I thought tapas were all bread with something on top haha! I love mushrooms so the sauteed one was my favorite. We also got a fried eggplant one and a brie (cheese) and both were delicious as well.
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,Dont go here. Take the next restaurant
Passeig 9,15 for 3 shots of Limoncello on the terrace.
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Well located, it has a terrace, the service is good. The prices are very high for the low quality of the food. Toast with Aioli, burnt, dry and a too simple sauce. The sauces on the patatas bravas were not good either."
Passeig 9,Good ubication. But the potatoes are the ugliest in Barcelona. The bread with aioli is embarrassing. Glass of cava  6 is a steal and the tapas are very average.
Passeig 9,"A disastrous experience. The attention is the worst I have seen. The food arrived cold, the beer was pure foam, I had to ask for it to be changed because it was embarrassing. We asked for the bill 3 times and no one was there. The worst thing is that the dishes are very expensive. Its not worth it at all. Do not go"
Passeig 9,Really good food and great service from the waiter
Passeig 9,Meat was not edible. rip off
Passeig 9,"Lived all around Spain and I ve NEVER paid 5 euro for a glass of wine at a  normal  bar. This is an abnormal bar. Nothing here makes any sense. Not the way that the server attends you, nor the menu, only a marked men s room, not a woman s room. Nor anything else. Was the wine good? Sure. But not 5 euro good. At all."
Passeig 9,Don t order beef. The beef is not fresh and rotten. they didn t think so. The mussel is so small. Grill vegetable and shrimps are good. Too Expensive!
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"The variety of tapas, the friendly atmosphere and the courteous staff are convincing."
Passeig 9,"Fabulous tapas, great wine - and super service thank you! Vegetarian options: I am veggie and great options"
Passeig 9,"Very central location, good food"
Passeig 9,Good tapas with very friendly service and surroundings. Do try.
Passeig 9,Correct food but small quantity compared to the price you pay for tapas.
Passeig 9,"Certainly the best meal in Barcelona. Starting with the service. A young girl full of happy and willing energy. Very presentable food, on a charming plate and with a divine flavor. A dessert so beautiful and delicious that there was no time to photograph it and, when ordering the brownie with ice cream to share between 2 people, it was very generous and prepared for it. The beauty of the place, the casualness with refinement, the climate, the comfort, the drinks (wines and coca cola) with this service, presentation and flavor, I have not found anywhere else in Spain, neither in Madrid nor in Barcelona. By far the best food I ate in Barcelona! Congratulations!!! Wheelchair accessibility: Street level."
Passeig 9,"Accueil sympa, service rapide. Cetait bon !"
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Good afternoon. We have just had lunch at Passeig 9. The attention received has been very good, it is called Karelys. The spectacular food: a cod au gratin and a very tender sirloin. With some starters of very fresh grilled calamari and some very tasty marinara mussels. Thank you so much. We will be back!"
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Restaurant sympa, la nourriture est tres bonne. Les serveuses sont sympas et ont fait l effort de parler francais. L endroit et la decoration sont vraiment top. Vraiment a faire pour manger un morceau le soir dans un quartier ideal. Merci de l accueil."
Passeig 9,"Tres bonne sole que jai pris plaisir a deguster, service impeccable avec une jeune serveuse marocaine ! Je recommande"
Passeig 9,"The most gorgeous restaurant I ever visited, beautiful decorations, delicious food, the best service I ever had"
Passeig 9,"It is a very good atmosphere, delicious food, good music and excellent food. The waitresses are very good people and provide wonderful service!!!"
Passeig 9,
Passeig 9,"Too expensive, 50 euros for 3 beers 1 order of fried chorizos and a few pieces of cheese and ham, a shame not to have read the reviews before, the service was good but the price is exaggerated"
Passeig 9,"okay, the prawns were nice. went for dinner and the waiters seem to try to upsell and tell you you havent ordered enough , (we ordered plenty and didnt even finish what we had ) the atmosphere inside is nice , the bathroom needs work though ..."

VIET THAI,"The food is good and authentic, in my opinion the best pad thai in Barcelona."
VIET THAI,This is not thai food and it was very very disapointing...
VIET THAI,Good food for reasonable prices.
VIET THAI,"It may not be the most authentic food nor have the most optimal decoration but overall, it is a highly recommended restaurant. Some dishes are great, the place is comfortable and informal and everything is very well served. Excellent price. Good coffee. To repeat without a doubt. We went as a group of 7 to eat."
VIET THAI,"delicious pho Whenever I leave Asia, I always miss noodles. Im Japanese, but when I go outside of Asia, I often go out to eat Thai or Vietnamese food. This is because overseas ramen is completely different from Japanese ramen and makes me miss Japan. However, I feel that the chances of finding a restaurant that tastes delicious in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine are relatively high even in Europe. The pho here is better than the pho in Singapore! When I thought about what would be delicious, I realized that it had a lot of fresh herbs on it. Vietnamese cuisine is delicious with herbs. This is rare in Singapore. It satisfied my craving for noodles, warmed my body, and was great value for money."
VIET THAI,"The food is delicious and the prices are good, but you leave the place smelling like food. I recommend that the owners check the exhaust fan because it is very unpleasant to leave the premises and smell like food. On the other hand, it is very noisy, so if you are looking for something quiet, this is not the place PS: The curry is very delicious"
VIET THAI,"For a menu, excellent. Delicious curry"
VIET THAI,"Poor food, we went. This  Viet -Thai restaurant, more like Thai with few Viet touches, guided by Google comments. We ordered the menu of the day, a menu with frankly small quantities. I ordered some chicken wings, 4 very small wings and a second curry with 3 scant pieces of beef (photo attached). My partner ordered a coconut soup (quite watery) and a pho (a broth with little flavor and hardly any chicken). The flavor in general was good, but the quantity was very very small, I think it is preferable that they raise the menu by Eur and increase quantities, or do not offer a menu of the day at all. As soon as we finished we had to go somewhere else to finish eating."
VIET THAI,"Actually the typical Thai flavor was non-existent, reaching bland"
VIET THAI,The pho soup didnt taste like Vietnamese soup. The rice noodles were very hard It tastes sad because this soup is really good when its done right.
VIET THAI,"The food very good. The pad Thai very delicious. Plus, the guys are super friendly."
VIET THAI,"The food is very good, and well priced, the waiters are very nice."
VIET THAI,"Excellent, very delicious pad thai"
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,It eats well. Recommended 100% quality price. The pad thai is very good. The quality and taste of the food is very good. They also have a daily menu. All dishes can be ordered in a vegetarian version.
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"Vietnamese food was ok, but the Thai dishes are not authentic."
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"The food is very good, well prepared and with a lot of flavor, it takes you to Thailand. The price is reasonable. What I could say as a negative is that you come out smelling a little fried."
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"The Tom yum gong soup is tremendous, the menu is very complete at a good price, and the pad Thai is also brutal. Very good food, quality, good price and good service. 100% recommended"
VIET THAI,"What an experience! I leave you directly my recommendations: - Fresh roll (x4) - Yellow curry (pica 2/10) - Rice noodles, any (I usually order pad Thai) I recommend eating upstairs, ordering some Estrella Galicia beers, which they serve great. The kitchen could manage the fumes better."
VIET THAI,"Everything we ordered was great: yellow curry, pad Thai, fresh rolls. Good price, good service. The best curry in Barcelona!"
VIET THAI,Cosmopolitan atmosphere and good food!
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"Very delicious food, menu of the day for 13eur, fast and very friendly service. The place is quite small, but the food is very very good!"
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,We make a reservation for the fork and when we call 5 minutes later they tell us not to go because the kitchen has closed. Spectacular
VIET THAI,"I ve visited several times and it s always delicious   Red curry   is highly recommended, if you love spicy"
VIET THAI,"We have really enjoyed the food, very well prepared and very delicious dishes!! We will return for sure"
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,Great chicken soup for a very good price.
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,I love coming here for their pad Thai and soups. Highly reccomended
VIET THAI,Cozy place to eat some Thai food!
VIET THAI,"Everything is delicious, they recommended it to me and I recommend it... Good prices, good flavor..."
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"We have been with friends and small children, we have been treated very well, the Pad Thai was well cooked as they do in Thailand. They have quite a few dishes and normal prices. A place to return to. Kid-friendliness: Its a place suitable for children, they adapt the dish and make it spicy. They made us a fried egg even though it wasnt on the menu because the little girl liked it."
VIET THAI,"Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, simple but very well cooked. Good soups; rice, pasta and curries. At very reasonable prices. They have cards in Catalan and part of the service can speak it. A point to improve are the wines; they are not local - none of the DOs. Catalan"
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"Good food, acceptable price and friendly service."
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"Good Vietnamese food,"
VIET THAI,"Today we went for the first time to Viet Thai, it is delicious, very homely food, all the dishes we ordered from the Thai chicken wings, Fresh Rolls, wanton soup and dishes with rice and 2 other Pad Thais very well prepared. The only reason I give them 4 stars and NOT 5 is because the service is not good. Being happier and more helpful attracts more people! Otherwise good guys! I will be back :)"
VIET THAI,"The food is delicious, but you leave with the smell of food on your clothes, because it seems that there is no extractor fan in the kitchen. Vegetarian options: There are options with tofu"
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"Not satisfied at all. Food wasn t good, soup was tasteless , beef was hard .."
VIET THAI,"Tasty tasty food, and a really excellent value for price lunch offer"
VIET THAI,"If you are in the area or near the area, please do not hesitate to go, it is delicious. I spent a day like someone who didnt want the thing and it caught my attention a lot and from then on it is my favorite Thai in terms of quality and price. I always ask for a menu and perfect staff."
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,"I can only comment on the menu of the day, I dont know what it will be like a la carte. I ordered wonton soup and pad thai. The soup base is avecrem, although the wontons were good. The pad thai is good, it helps take away the hiccups, but if you want a traditional flavor it is not achieved. Also, they have added too much sugar, I would say. Overall rating: Its okay, but if youve tried authentic Thai food youre going to be quite critical. The price is VERY good:  12.50 full menu. If I lived in Bcn I would surely repeat for general quality-price from time to time."

VIET THAI,Dinner with family. Ignore the decoration. The food of ten.
VIET THAI,"We had a reservation for 9pm and showed up at 9. When we stated we had a reservation a staff member rudely told us there were no tables and that we had to wait for 20 minutes, he didn t even apologise so we left. Wasted our time. Do not go here!"
VIET THAI,"We made a reservation well in advance, arrived slightly early to ensure we did  not lose our table, and when we got the the waiter said you can wait. They did not hold the reservation and we were left standing in the rain. I would understand if he even apologised but no he just says you can wait and walks away. Will not be going back here..."
VIET THAI,"The environment is very bad, the smell of oil smoke is very strong, the food is very sweet and unauthentic (made for Spanish people) and the service staff has a bad attitude"
VIET THAI,A highly recommended Thai restaurant. Great prices. Big and tasty portions. The Pad Thai was very successful. And a dish of chicken and pineapple. A small portion of soup.
VIET THAI,Good lunch menu
VIET THAI,
VIET THAI,

VIET THAI,"Be sure to try the coconut milk soup In general, all the dishes are delicious and have interesting combinations like chicken with mango and caramel"
VIET THAI,"We went in for dinner and had their menu para dos. It had some rolls, pho, and pad thai. The serving was good and the servers were very friendly. Price  -"
VIET THAI,Well enough
VIET THAI,100% gluten free with lots of vegetarian options. Super affordable as well.
VIET THAI,"Great value for money. Quite smelly though, but expected anyway. The coconut sauce is awesome!"

VIET THAI,"Their food is delicious, with respect and care for the preparation of the different tastes of each person."
VIET THAI,First time eating in a Vietnamese and the truth is that I loved it. I will repeat.
VIET THAI,Excellent Thai Vietnamese restaurant Perfect Asian dishes A place worth visiting
VIET THAI,"Everything is very delicious, especially the glutinous rice with mango. They have a sharing plate that is very suitable for trying a few things from gastronomy."
VIET THAI,The dishes are very pretty with a good price.
VIET THAI,Fast service Menu available during the week. Small but cozy place
VIET THAI,Industrial food.

EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,"The food here is amazing! The flavorful lamb rice is served piping hot. The heat you see is enough to show how authentic it is! It s hard to imagine that my first dinner in Barcelona would be an Uzbek meal. It s so delicious, hot food in the winter makes people feel happy. Not to mention the friendly service, with the owner using his patience to ensure everyone gets the best possible care. 5/5. I recommend this excellent restaurant!"
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,"We really liked it, large portions, khanum is just one tier from the manty shashlik, delicious, like at home, we took baked bones with silt (incredibly tasty), samosas, manti, shorpo, shish kebab, a plate with pickles - magic, plus attentive , friendly service. Lucky residents of Barcelona."

EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,Really great Uzbekistan cuisine with a wide range of Spanish dishes as well. I will be back
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,Nice place - friendly owner
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,"Our visit to EdeNova was one of the most interesting one in Barcelona. That day we wanted to enjoy some Georgian food and went to a restaurant called Supra that was recommended to us by a local friend. We were greeted with a cold and condescending welcome, when two people, probably from the restaurant staff, were standing at the entrance smoking, so that all the smoke went inside. The place smelled like a club and the attitude was cold and condescending as mentioned. We decided within 10 minutes to leave before even ordering a drink. In that sense, our arrival at EdeNova was probably the directed hand of the universe to correct the strange experience we experienced in supra. We were greeted with a warm and pleasant welcome, we received a detailed explanation of all the dishes and we received cocktails that were clearly made by professionals. The Bukhari food served to us was delicious, very fresh and with very special flavors. As mentioned, the atmosphere was perfect and we felt at home there (only with much better food  :) Thanks to Yael and Teddy, we ended our day perfectly. We will definitely come back again."
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,"In this place you have to try typical Central Asian cuisine: plov, chebureki, salads, manti, and honey cake for dessert. Highly recommended!"
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,This place is not it
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,"The vegetable paella was incredible. The food takes a while (to be expected with paella of course) so come on a day you have plenty of time to enjoy. Definitely would come back for the paella and to try some more of the Uzbek dishes! Vegetarian options: The paella was vegan, I recommend for even non-vegans"
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,Good food and fair prices
EdeNova Restaurant Barcelona,"Food was yummy, my husband really loved his lyulya kebab, sashlik was also good. And that s so nice that the owner helps with service."

Sense Seny Restaurant,Highly recommended! The food is very good!
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Jai trouve les gambas fraiches et bonnes. Le calamar etait cuit parfaitement, la demi carotte daccompagnement etait crue. En revanche, cest cher pour des quantites minimes. Et si on ne consomme pas dalcool, pas le droit a un verre deau plate du robinet   il faut acheter de leau en bouteille."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Quite good! Very fresh, creative dishes. Cocktails are good, too. The prawns are surprisingly tender, and the garlic aroma is fascinating, my favo. The Miss who serve us is very nice! Speaks many languages. It was a great experience."

Sense Seny Restaurant,Good food.
Sense Seny Restaurant,"The food is no different from instant cooking and has no taste. Worst value for money compared to food price Staff service was good, honestly, it was really bad. Theres nothing to take a picture for Instagram. Oh, Im angry. I stayed 12 nights in Basel and I really dont want to go back to this place. But why is the review rating so high? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Thank you for your reply, so I am adding the review from here. Im sure its your store. The hotel I stayed at is the Condens across from your store. Since there is no room for excuses, I think they made a mistake by saying it was a different store. Admit what you have to admit and make improvements. The excuses are just as disgusting as the food and service. Let me add one more thing. There are many reviews I wrote on Google. You are the second to give one star. You guys are the first The receipt below is uploaded for people in our country to see. You dont care To our citizens One receipt was from this store in early December 23. The other thing is the details of what I used in Bangkok during the Christmas season in 2023. I attached the Bangkok receipt to show that I am not a beginner in travel in case this restaurant makes some strange excuse. Traveling twice a month is not something a beginner can do. Anyway, restaurants like this are rare. If you are going, please make up your mind. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You edit your reply and add more content. In your first reply, you said that you mistook me for another store and your store, right? I completely erased that content. I should have apologized instead of deleting it. This is just your level and proof that you are a liar. And Ill never go to your store again my time is precious ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
Sense Seny Restaurant,
Sense Seny Restaurant,"This restaurant was a pleasant discovery for us. Very tasty cuisine, so much so that we came back several times. Wonderful waitress Nicole, friendly, polite and always with a sincere smile. We recommend visiting"
Sense Seny Restaurant,"The shrimp werent cooked and the food was hard and tasteless, like pre-cooked food or reheated food. Really haha. I went there after looking at the star rating, but I was fooled + After lunch, I got hungry and vomited, and Ive been suffering for several days as if I had food poisoning!!!"

Sense Seny Restaurant,PERFECT!  Dont miss this place if you re visiting barcelona. It s really close to casa mila

Sense Seny Restaurant,"Great dinner at Sense Seny! My favorites: the sauteed calamari in an incredible garlic tomato oil, the fried pimento peppers, and the mushroom wontons with a delicious truffle mayo. The pecking duck cannelloni was just okay and the shrimp cheese fried balls were quite tough, though tasty. Really enjoyable experience overall and fairly priced. I d definitely go back."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Excellent food n service. We had dinner here twice during our stay. The gambas in oil, beef sliders, mushroom wanton, salmon tartare and avocado and grilled calamari are not to be missed!"
Sense Seny Restaurant,Central and very nice place. You eat relatively well for  16 a menu. The menu is not too elaborate but at those prices it is what they usually give.
Sense Seny Restaurant,

Sense Seny Restaurant,"The best restaurant I visited during my week in Barcelona! Food, atmosphere, service, nothing missing There is nothing. suggestion!"
Sense Seny Restaurant,"I went because I saw a video that said it was worth 13 euros, I understand that the prices have increased and now it is worth 16 euros, the food was acceptable but small in quantity, the best options come with a supplement. In my opinion it is expensive, for what it is."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"I would definitely come back, excellent"

Sense Seny Restaurant,"We had dinner on a Saturday in November, we had no prior reservation, it was a very pleasant positive surprise, a reference place to return to, centrally located, very good quality/price ratio!, generous portions and very attentive service!"
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Smelt amazing when we got in, especially after a long day of walking and sightseeing. Lovely staff and they were joking around with each other and it made the atmosphere feel so friendly and comfortable. Service as well was spot on, food came out very quickly and was the best thing Ive ever eaten for the Royal Slider. They have English and Spanish menus and cater to both easily. Only slightly terrifying when the prawns came out with heads!"
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Based on the reviews, I thought it would be good, so I went there around 6:30 to have an early dinner. I hesitated for a while because there were no customers in the restaurant, but the rib eye steak, paella, and creamy burrata salad were all top quality. It suited Korean tastes well. There were no issues with language communication with the staff and the service was satisfactory."

Sense Seny Restaurant,
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Cozy atmosphere with a chic touch, very friendly staff. Correct portions but some with a price that is too high for the quality of the dish, such as the meat. Come on...expensive for the size of the portions. For the bill price of 2, we ate 4 elsewhere."
Sense Seny Restaurant,Nice place. Food and drinks were good. Service was excellent but try to make reservations as walk ins may be poorly received. A little warm and no outside tables. A wonderful restaurant to avoid the more tourist trap areas.
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Situated close to a great shopping district. The food is casual, yet refined and affordable. You won t find this quality of food in this price range. I really don t know how they do it and still stay in business."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Great food and service! We had the garlic prawns, the seafood rice and the burrata. For the desert was the flan."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Staff were all very friendly. Food was excellent. We had the goat cheese salad, mushroom wontons and potato bravos. Overall vibe was modern and comfortable. Highly recommend."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Nice, clean, neat, but not at all tasty - chicken nuggets (they have a different name for something like Chicken Krispies) even an adult couldn t chew, but we ordered a three-year-old child, the steak is completely tasteless. In short, I dont recommend it to eat."
Sense Seny Restaurant,"Very good experience. Without a doubt, one of the best food places I have been to in Barcelona. The quality and quantity of food go hand in hand. Special thanks to Nicole, Thomas, Dantony and Martin for their attention. 100% recommended"

Sense Seny Restaurant,
Sense Seny Restaurant,"After eating lots of Tapas during our stay in Barcelona, we saved the best for last. We had five different options and all of them were absolutely delicious. Not only that- the meat was super tender and the seafood was prepared in an authentic and tasty way. The staff was friendly and helpful navigating our way through the menu. Definitely recommend going there when given the chance."

ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Un kebab barcelonaid sympa. La cuisine est bonne et laccueil sympa
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,A small ration of French fries for a little girl to take away is 3 euros!! Ladron
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"Describing a racist is easy, but here I come to express my opinion. As for the service, they are extremely precarious. They dont use gloves. They touch everything with their hands and then they bring you your plate, (touched by the entire staff,) it is not beef or chicken who knows what it will be. but they gave me a night that stays for me. I wouldnt advise even my worst enemy to visit this place. and you inflate them with superiority when you have the brains to be polite, there you will show that you are worth something. but I wouldnt even go for a gift again."
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,SCAMERS! Be really careful if you go here. Pay up front or they will charge you with things you didnt even order. (How can you count wrong more than 6 drinks...?). Besides when trying to explain that we didnt order that the owner started shouting with very bad manners. ( all this after paying more than 100 euros).
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"The worst durum I have ever eaten, very bad taste and little meat... very disappointing, I had to throw it away carrying half because it was inedible"
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Hidden foodgem in Barcelona!
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"Disgraceful manners of the manager, after leaving more than  100 on dinner, a friend who drank non-alcoholic and arrived at the end, they wanted to fit her 6 non-alcoholic beers, taking 30 minutes. The owner got angry and we didnt leave the bar without paying that extra 8.60, when they had no organization system other than 4 separate notes, shameful."
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"Nos cobraron de mas. Cuando fuimos a pagar, tenian para nuestra mesa tres cuentas abiertas y el calculo no cuadraba con lo que pedimos. Despues de discutir y comentarles que no tenia sentido lo de las tres cuentas ni lo que nos querian cobrar, no entraban en razon. Pagamos al final de mas para terminar con la discusion. Para nada recomendable"
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Awful

I ve dined in & had take away. Both of high standard & the freshest ingredients. Vegetarian options: Caters for all Parking: An easy walk Kid-friendliness: Absolutely kid friendly"
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Kebab was veeery good
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"During my tour of Barcelona and before arriving at the beach, which was very close, what motivated me to choose the restaurant was the halal service, the presence of space to sit outside in the shade and indoors, despite the lack of ventilation, but the atmosphere was acceptable. The waiter was extremely courteous and sophisticated. I charged my phone and my stomach with delicious food and prepared it. I ordered until I was full, thank God, and I finished it with coffee at a table outside the restaurant on a busy street with pedestrians. I highly recommend it and thank you for the service"
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Good service and tasty food!
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"The food was super bad, the chicken was in bad condition and the salad was already stale and had a very bad taste. We mentioned it to the waiters but they didnt give it any importance."
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"Very large menu with very different dishes. We ate there several times and werent disappointed once. Very tasty and cheap, the portions were also decent. Staff very friendly even if we just wanted to drink a beer, a 0.3 cana for 2.80 euros. Conclusion: cheap and very tasty Wheelchair accessibility: Of course no problem on the terrace, space has even been made available in the restaurant for a severely disabled person, provided there is space."
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,I was starving and I think almost any durum would have satisfied me; Unfortunately it was one of the worst durums I have ever tried; It had a very strange aftertaste.

Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant."
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Fried and simple food. A celiac here cannot eat anything
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"I arrived at 11:05 p.m., closing time, its normal that they dont want to serve me unless its because they stay up late with other people who hadnt even given them the letter (a group of 10+ people) but they told us Its a bad way that we left when there were only 3 people to have a simple soft drink when the rest of them had practically not even been given the menu, in that time when you prepare 10 dinners with kebab and all-inclusive with leftovers you can serve 3 CocaColas. When they checked us out it was already 11:15 p.m. (they hadnt even attended to us or those next door, which was enough reason not to check us out and even more so)"
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,Very good restaurant of street food.

ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,A good Durum for  5
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,The food is very good and the service is very fast. The staff laugh. We will return again and again.
ZOZAN Restaurant Gourmet,"Dont be put off by the rustic furnishings. We were there with a family of five. You can also sit comfortably outside, not far from the beach. The staff is friendly, patient and helpful, the service is quick and uncomplicated. The price-performance ratio is unbeatable. If you want to eat delicious kebab (from Germany) or vegetarian and Turkish starters, this is the right place for you. The tuna pizza - specially made in a small format for my son - is, unlike the other pizzas in the area, not burnt (carcinogenic), rich in toppings and tasty. My boys love them. The owner Hakans homemade garlic sauce is first class. Never had such a tasty sauce with crispy calamari. I can also recommend the fried small peppers, dont worry - they arent spicy!"

Tiflis Restaurant,"If the restaurant is named Tiflis, please follow the traditions. The waiters dont understand Russian and Georgian. Prices are expensive."
Tiflis Restaurant,"This is the worst Georgian restaurant I ve ever visited. Lemonade was good though, because it s not a product of this restaurant. For these prices the quality of the food is horrible. Also on Saturday s evening there were no people at all, except me and my girlfriend. So it s a bad sign. Moreover this restaurant is full of small mosquitos. There are a lot of good Georgian restaurants in Barcelona, please, choose another one."

I called this morning and yesterday and always got the answering machine...."
Tiflis Restaurant,"The worst restaurant I visited in Barcelona! Never book a large event at this restaurant. They charged us 70 euros each, but gave us food and wine for 5-7 people. They are scammers and I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone! I will sue for their aphorisms!"

Good reviews are probably only from your own!"
Tiflis Restaurant,"We ordered delivery through Glovo today 01/28/23, we ordered 2 kebabs, Adjarian khachapuri, 10 khinkali, dolma, badrijani and chashushuli. Khachapuri is simply terrible! The size of a mans palm, there was almost no cheese filling, there was nothing to stir!!! and thats for 17.50 ! Kebab - tasteless, minced meat in khinkali - no, an incomprehensible mess, there wasn t even any broth inside, dry! Badrijani - delicious. Dolma is a super small portion but delicious. Chashushuli - so-so. We love Georgian cuisine, but this was a shame! I don t know about the establishment itself, but the delivery was disgraceful! I dont recommend it! The previous review was blocked by the owners of the establishment, but it s okay, I ll leave it again) so that people know"

Tiflis Restaurant,Highly recommend the Adjaruli Khachapuri that they make    congratulations
Tiflis Restaurant,"This restaurant is great! I noticed a recent review (probably from a fake account) claiming that Churchhella was served here and that it was old. Just to clarify   Restaurant Tiflis does not have Churchhella on their menu, so thats impossible. Before coming on this page to leave a negative review in order to harm the overall rating of the restaurant, maybe at least, call ahead and find out if they sell the thing you are criticizing"
Tiflis Restaurant,"grilled veggies and saperavi are great. chicken soup could be better (and croutons fresher). service also good, i ve never seen bad service in georgian restaurants :)"
Tiflis Restaurant,"I ordered a Georgian dessert churchhella by phone and came to pick up at the restaurant. Each one cost 6 euro! I should try one right there, but I havent. All of 3 i bought were very old and totally dried. And has a smell and favor of a sausage due to incorrect storage. Its a shame to sell what its time to throw away!"
Tiflis Restaurant,The food was delicious and the service was great.
Tiflis Restaurant,"I hasten to share my impressions, yesterday we had a business dinner in this wonderful restaurant, I thought the cook and waiters couldn t handle it, but no, I was very surprised that the service remained excellent, the cuisine is incomparable.

Tiflis Restaurant,"The waitress was very friendly. The food all suited my taste and was delicious. Maybe they turned off the air conditioner while eating, but it was so hot that it was difficult."
Tiflis Restaurant,"The two waiters were very friendly and attentive. We had a very good dinner, the Georgian wine they recommended to us was a success. Quality-price is not bad. I dont give it five stars because for my taste the cheese in the Adjaruli Khachapuri was too dense. For the rest a success, we will surely return."
Tiflis Restaurant,"I enjoyed the flavours of the bbq chicken but feel its outpriced for 16 euros, especially that portion. Coffee tasted burnt sadly but again i did enjoy the simple flavour of the chicken"

Tiflis Restaurant,"The food is very tasty, everything is like in Georgia. But out of three dishes, two were mixed up, although they seemed to understand English, and I clearly pointed my finger at the photographs on the menu. And expensive."
Tiflis Restaurant,"Today we went to this place for lunch. I wanted Georgian cuisine. It s stuffy inside, there are several tables outside. The menu is old, falling apart and the prices have been posted several times over. We chose Adjarian khachapuri, lula, pkhali. When ordering, they pointed at the menu and at the picture. In the end, they brought the wrong thing...Migrelian khachapuri! Instead of Adjarian... Instead of lula, pork kebab. Oh my! Why give guests a menu? You can just serve what you have)) I wont go a second time."
Tiflis Restaurant,Extremely overpriced

Restaurant Parkguell,ATTENTION TOURISTS. VERY ATTENTION. ILL EDUCATED AND ABSURD PRICES!!!
Restaurant Parkguell,Our experience is different from the other recommendations. We ate a Bocadillo with Chorizo and had Coffee and Soft drinks. Was great for people watching and all food and drinks were good. Can recommend. Food
Restaurant Parkguell,"The reviews are right! DONT GO THERE! The only highlight was the pigeon that walked up the basement stairs. Maybe it escaped downstairs before becoming a pollo empanada... Everything inedible, plastic cups instead of glasses, unfriendly waiters, 6% service charge for no reason, 10% for consuming on the terrace! The worst experience we have had in Barcelona"
Restaurant Parkguell,Surement le pire endroit de Barcelone....
Restaurant Parkguell,came home and got food poisoning and then threw up for hours the next day
Restaurant Parkguell,Touristy food but decent. Vegetarian options.
Restaurant Parkguell,"DO NOT EAT HERE THEY ARE SCAMMERS... FLEE!!!!!! I didnt pay attention to the bad ratings of this restaurant, I still ate here and the comments were not wrong. Bad, expensive food and it is the first time that I feel like they wanted to scam me all the time with the prices. To the published price they added an extra 10% VAT and 10% extra for the use of the terrace to eat. Some very hard-working workers. At the time of paying he refused to accept the card payment, he insisted that the payment be in cash, I imagine they do it to evade taxes. TOURISTS STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Bad and expensive food, I only ate everything because I was very hungry, they sell you chicken breast, but in reality it is a slice of breast, the only thing that was good were the fries. Later they tell you that the machine is bad, they charge you for the terrace even though they have not served you there. Be careful, they are professional scammers."
Restaurant Parkguell,Nice food and good atmosphere
Restaurant Parkguell,The service was horrible and pretty sure the chicken was not chicken. Would NOT recommend.
Restaurant Parkguell,"I went there with a friend to eat. We took two spaghetti, the taste was just okay but the portion was very small! The stuff dont make you feel welcome at all! The restaurant was empty inside with lot of tables and when we asked for a bigger table at first cause we had lot of staff they were rude and refused us to move to another. Inappropriate and unprofessional!!!"
Restaurant Parkguell,They sort of the sangria and told us we could drink it anywhere while walking around. It turns out that it was actually just cranberry juice without any alcohol in it. Which I ended up finding out once I got arrested for having it in my hand while walking around because I was breathalyzed and I blew a 0.0.
Restaurant Parkguell,"Exorbitant price, I felt ripped off. For a beer  6.05. Not recommendable"
Restaurant Parkguell,Very expensive. Mistreatment. Dont stop.
Restaurant Parkguell,Tourist trap 100% don t go . everything about this place sucks
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,Prices through the roof.. Mammma mia!
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,House vermouth - martini in a shot... fatal. I do not recommend at all
Restaurant Parkguell,"You were really hungry, but it was delicious. But... the food overall seems too salty for my taste. I think I consumed almost a months worth of salt in one meal. The staff are also very friendly."
Restaurant Parkguell,"Restaurant dedicated to street food, offering seats both inside and outside (if you like to eat following the inclination of the road  )! The dishes are good and rightly portioned in relation to their price: fast and helpful service"
Restaurant Parkguell,Very delicious paella!   Thank you!
Restaurant Parkguell,"The pizza is from the supermarket next door, overall the pizza are in very bad condition and it tastes horrible. Do you try this expensive and bad tasting restaurant this is for the very best of you."
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,Overpriced tourist trap. Serving frozen pizza.
Restaurant Parkguell,Mean people running the place. Very greedy. Stay away
Restaurant Parkguell,"Really good food. Its worth entering. Everythings great! Salmon and octopus done on point. Only the music, not so much... But the service was great and the coffee was good (both cava and coffe)."
Restaurant Parkguell,thanks for the great food all the way from UAE Food : 5/5
Restaurant Parkguell,Never to eat here! I would not dare to serve this to anyone!
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,"Cest le bar de passe ton chemin. Si tu veux boire une biere. Attention les prix dans la carte sont hors-taxe. Attention au 10 % a la sortie. Bonne chance a vous. Si vous faites pas engueuler en rentrant dans le bar, il faut rester sur la terrasse et mechante pente"
Restaurant Parkguell,Coffee and drinks from a paper cup on an extremely dirty table. Luckily we didnt eat anything.
Restaurant Parkguell,Fun lunch stop Recommend  paella Food
Restaurant Parkguell,Guys fix the level of the outdoor i get nausa there
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,Do NOT go here. It s overpriced. Not even run by Spanish people. They do not make good food. We paid $15 for 6 tiny little shrimps. Doesn t look like the photos at all and overpriced given the location. Just walk a litttttle bit more and find something 637383 times better. Bathroom gross. Nothing good to say about the entire place and creepy employees.
Restaurant Parkguell,"Had a chicken panini, was the most disgusting food I have eaten EVER. Chicken was clearly microwaved with herbs SPRINKLED on top, tomatoes were like slush.. Unfortunately payed PS17 euros for two of those and 2 coffees. Save your money and go to a little caffe around the corner. As we went to pay inside the waiter took a PHOTO of my behind whilst I wasnt looking but was told of what had happened. Awful awful awful, dont fund this establishment."
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,"Alors je nai vraiment pas pour habitude de mettre ce genre de commentaire mais mis a part la nourriture le service etait plus que moyen. Je vous assure que navais pas encore fini de manger, que lont nous a donne la note   . Jetais choque de plus ont ne nous a ni propose de dessert ni de cafe mais a fallu attendre plus de dix minutes montre en main  peronne ne venait chercher la note serieux quoi mon mari a du se deplacer a linterieur et le mec parle a un autre gars chose normal il attend le mec ce retourne et lui agite les doigts mon mari a dit oui il paye ni un merci ni un au revoir rien !! dune impolitesse dune mauvaise education. Donc aucun pourboires qui est tendance a la generosite Jetais plus en colere, car je navais pas mis mon tel en fonction et regarder justement les appreciations sinon ont ne sy serait meme pas arrete au vu des commentaires que jai pu voir quoi quil en sout cela mapprendra au final. Dans la logique ils sont la aussi pour gagner leurs vie je pense donc politesse service accueil doit etre present pour faire fonctionner un commerce. Desole de ce message mais une premiere pour moi de commenter de la sorte mais les personnes qui veulent y venir le seront avant. Bien a vous christele"
Restaurant Parkguell,Increase in the final price
Restaurant Parkguell,A bottle of water to take away three euros. exaggerated price
Restaurant Parkguell,"The worst ever hamburger that I ever had. It tasted like fish!!!! And with a drink it cost 30 Euros....! I could have a good stake in the city with this price. Never try this resturant. Low quality, high price in a nutshell."
Restaurant Parkguell,"Very expensive, sangria is pure cava, bad service"
Restaurant Parkguell,"This was the worst food we have ever been served at a restaurant. The food comes straight from a can and is heated in a warming cabinet, dry tasteless and really boring. Many in the group didnt even dare to eat their food because of how unhygienic everything was cooked (heated). 5 out of 8 people left all their food and the staff just shrug their shoulders and dont look very concerned. Despite this, we had to pay for all the dishes. One of the drinks we got was wrong and not the one we had ordered, when we pointed this out the staff took the drink back and shouted at each other before we finally got the right drink. However, we had to pay for the incorrect drink which the staff took back. The absolute worst restaurant experience we have ever had. Would not eat there again even if we got the food for free. Go somewhere else."
Restaurant Parkguell,"Mother of god sir, please someone bring a professor to take a look at this letter. There is nowhere to take it. You ask for a Cacaolat and they bring you a Cocacola (if its fine Ill be fine if its not), a slice (on top)  1.93. I take it here and they give it to me in a glass to take away... anyway..."
Restaurant Parkguell,"Nous avons globalement mal apprecie de restaurant qui propose des plats de fast food. Certains plats ne figurent pas, dautres ont un prix exorbitant 3  pour 0.25l de Coca Cola. Leur croque monsieur etait au moins comestible, bien que la tranche de fromage avait une texture et un gout proche des eco+. Les sandwichs non plus netait pas bons mais ont remercieras leffort consacrees aux frites et a celui qui a vide le sel dessus, il a du passer une sale journee. Toilettes extremement sales et avec une bonne odeur nauseabondes  vous en ressortirez a demander a payer separe mais cest impossible, il y a un probleme dixit le serveur suivit dun vous avez compris dun air hautain et plus quidiot. A fuir, le choix pharamineux de plats que la globalite du restaurant sont a refaire."
Restaurant Parkguell,"Place is good, food is great and fast service. These negative reviews are not accurate. I enjoyed eating here. Price is good too"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Comment un tel etablissement peut-etre ouvert le coca 3  nest pas frais, on vous facture des prix plus cher et biensur on ne vous donne pas de ticket de caisse pour vous entuber ce sont des pakistanais qui vous vendent des plats rechauffes donc rien dEspagnol et les quantites sont petite. Le serveur incapable de venir vous voir meme quand vous avez fini. Cest une honte ce chauffeur de plat. Etablissement a fermer !"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Service deplorable, on nous sert la paella sans assiette, le serveur vraiment pas aimable, il ne prend meme pas la peine de venir debarasser et surprise quand il sagit de payer 2e de plus que sur la carte pourquoi on ne sait pas et bien sur on vous donne pas de tickets. Vous etes servi comme dans un bar, les quantites sont ridicule et la carte est la meme partout dans le coin. Bref un attrape touriste."
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,Ce nest pas de la cuisine mais du service de plats de supermarche. Rien de mauvais mais rien de bon en soit
Restaurant Parkguell,"Rude staff, expensive and disgusting food"
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,Excellent coffee
Restaurant Parkguell,Good place great service no reason for bad reviews
Restaurant Parkguell,"Hello! I honestly feel cheated. Super market olives that cost  1 a jar, pint beer and small bottle water. Total  13. They are not ashamed of what they charge you, it is excessive and insulting. Price-quality is IMPOSSIBLE to measure. Not once again in this area. Horrible, for foreign tourists who dont care about money."
Restaurant Parkguell,Shrimp wasnt cleaned in my dish. The service vas disappointing.
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,"Tres decu. Personnel peu aimable et alors que nous commandons des tapas a partager entre amis, on nous sert de la charcuterie de supermarche sous vide. Une chose est sur, ce que lon sert ne ressemble en rien a la carte."
Restaurant Parkguell,THE WORST FOOD YOU COULD EVER FIND! Overpriced and disgusting Food
Restaurant Parkguell,Rude and takes 30 min for 4 sandwich. Indian drill music
Restaurant Parkguell,"Nous nous asseyons sur la terrasse et commandons des patates brava et a boire apres 10 15 min d attente pour que la serveuse nous servent. Elle nous explique que nous ne mangeons pas suffisamment pour rester sur la terrasse a cote un couple mange un burger apparemment cela est suffisent pour rester sur la terrasse Au moment de payer il ont rajouter 10 % de tva. Personnel non aimable Ensuite la terrasse est vide , le serveur racole les passant Mon conseil soyez plus aimable avec les clients et indiquer que la tva n est pas comprise dans le prix Je ne retournerai plus la bas"
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,It doesnt seem like the photos displayed outside really correspond to what is served: the fried fish was inedible... the meat was so-so.... 2 stars for encouragement...
Restaurant Parkguell,"Is this a joke? We went in, ate and when I ve checked the reviews . 2 Stars. I mean come on people. The service was good, the food was more than good. And yes, there is cold soup served :), this regarding the cold food. This is the type of soup."
Restaurant Parkguell,Very dry and tasteless food
Restaurant Parkguell,Complete
Restaurant Parkguell,"I think the online reviews are very unfair. We had the chicken croquettes, delux potatoes, mini chorizo, and the olives (stuffed with garlic). Service was super quick and friendly   Food was great!"
Restaurant Parkguell,"lol probably the worst food I ve had in my life. Feel bad posting this review because I m outing myself for falling for such a terrible tourist trap. There s no service over there, so it s not like you can check these reviews either"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Quite regrettable food, the two waiters didnt know anything, small and expensive portions... I wouldnt recommend it at all, honestly."
Restaurant Parkguell,im done
Restaurant Parkguell,The dishes and service are very good!!!
Restaurant Parkguell,"Food is very good, good workers, speaks well about"
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,Its really fast and good service
Restaurant Parkguell,Really good food And employers are very good and very humble Manager is kind and humble
Restaurant Parkguell,"The only thing that is almost  decent  from this place is the beer, we ordered 2 empanadas and where cold, like fridge cold, horrible experience, DO NOT GO!"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Nous avons commande 2 bieres pression en 33 cl a 3  lune. Le serveur a tres bien compris ce que nous lui avions commande. Au moment de payer, la note passe a 11  en nous disant quils nous avez servi des 50 cl ! Vente forcee ! A FUIR !!!"
Restaurant Parkguell,"One star is already too much. Bad food and bad service. Tourist trap. Avoid. They served our order to another table by mistake. Didn t seem too bothered when told, and didn t even apologise. One of us got our food AFTER the others finished."
Restaurant Parkguell,"The steak is the worst, the paella is the worst...   ."
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,"Lunch at Restaurant Parkguell was a disaster, particularly due to the calamari and paella fiasco. The calamari, an appalling flour-based imitation, had an unnatural white color and crumbled into small pieces. We ordered a seafood paella expecting an authentic experience, but what we received was a fake dish containing only one shrimp, one crayfish, and the same fraudulent calamari. Combined with undercooked, frozen entrees, our disappointment knew no bounds. When we confronted the waiter about the deceitful dishes, they stubbornly persisted with their dishonesty, further souring our experience. Save yourself the trouble, and steer clear of this lunchtime calamity at Restaurant Parkguell."
Restaurant Parkguell,"This restaurant is a big tourist scam. Just because it s the first restaurant you see after visiting the park, you ll probably think about eating here. Don t do it! We ordered some tapas, they were made in the microwave and we got them cold. When we mentioned they were cold, they put them back in the microwave and we got the same products back again all soft and soggy and not crunchy at all (like chicken croquettes use to be). The serving took quite a while also sadly. Would for sure not recommend eating here."
Restaurant Parkguell,Guys! Be careful! Read the newest review! We forgot to read it and then I understood. Check out our paella. Check out the pizza in the review fotos. Its all from the fridge of supermarkets!
Restaurant Parkguell,"Mediocre experience. As far as food is concerned, I was that close to vomiting. Food is actually FROZEN and then MICROWAVED (its not even mentioned in the menu!!!). Fresh food has nothing to do with this place. However the staff was helpful and kind and the atmosphere was appealing. I dont recommend it at all unless you have enough time , energy and money to waste!!"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Awful food , our plates were microwaved and not fresh , its a tourist trap dont go there"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Fuyez ! Fuyez ! Fuyez ! Tres mauvais, limite intoxication alimentaire. Aucun ordre dans larrivee des plats. Et niveau prix,  cest du VOL ! A ce niveau la, ce nest plus un attrape touristes mais une arnaque touristique. Ce restaurant devrait fermer purement et simplement."
Restaurant Parkguell,"Absolutely disgusting food. I got undercooked and hard pasta stuffed with meat. A couple of hours later, I threw up several times. This restaurant is definitely the reason why I threw up. I don t recommend to go here it is a tourist trap!"
Restaurant Parkguell,
Restaurant Parkguell,"ah bah alors la je m attendais a tout sauf a ca, c etait repugnant."
Restaurant Parkguell,The bad and expensive food I do not recommend! The paella has nothing to do with the paella of Spain!
Restaurant Parkguell,The food is not good and dont look like in the picture
Restaurant Parkguell,"Basic and poorly cut pizza, at the entrance it said beer for  1 but then when I ordered it was only  1 if I was going to take the beer away... Normal service, employee poor in English, but apparently friendly, quick service."
Restaurant Parkguell,"really anti-social!!! We thought we couldnt go wrong...cut!! Eating the greatest gaudi, from ready-made pizza to mini lasagna, just to avoid. please just steer clear thanks GaLiGru travel group chaos"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Possibly the worst bar restaurant in all of Barcelona. These types of bars are popping up like mushrooms near very touristy places and generally run by foreigners who have never tried a paella, much less made it, in their fucking life. They are bait restaurants. A robbery. Bars set up and transferred by unscrupulous speculators. Walking a little further towards grace, your stomach and your pocket will thank you."
Restaurant Parkguell,"I was hungry and went to the first restaurant that was nearby. And its just amazing! I havent seen such bad service and food in a very long time. Expensive, tasteless, terrible service."
Restaurant Parkguell,"The staff was rude to us after they heard we spoke English. The portions were tiny and they didn t even bring us plates to eat our food. We had to eat over our napkins. When we asked for plates the lady was mumbling under her breath in Spanish and brought us less plates than the amount of people we were. Last but not least, we asked them for some tap water and they replied that they don t have tap water. However, I guess serving water bottles is pretty common in European countries."
Restaurant Parkguell,"I dont recommend the misleading menu at all, we ordered baguette and were presented with flavorless burnt bread for a ridiculous price."
Restaurant Parkguell,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Rude and poorly mannered staff. The food is terrible, questionable quality and the portions is smaller than expected. WORST PLACE EVER! AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!"
Restaurant Parkguell,"Vraiment mauvais! Qualite horrible, service nul, nous avons commande simplement quelques tapas et deux plats ils ont oublie la moitie de la commande, tout est plein d huile, vraiment vraiment a fuir!"

Fortunately I found it while the paella was still on plate, because imagine eating a piece of glass while being on vocation! In the other paella we found a piece of plastic. In the end, even though we complained ti the waiter, we paid the full bill! Nonsense! Make sure to check your food before eating here, or don t eat at all!"

It was my first time eating at a Spanish restaurant, and it was so delicious that it was worth the price. It tasted even better because the clerk responded in simple Korean. This is a delicious calamari restaurant."
The famous Bar restaurant,"I recently dined at [The famous Bar restaurant Barcelona, Spain] and was blown away by the exceptional service and delicious food!

The famous Bar restaurant,Very good restaurant. The staff is very friendly and kind
The famous Bar restaurant,"Not the best food on our visit... We were looking for somewhere with a more local/authentic vibe and this place didnt look too pretentious so we tried it out. Overall food was okayish, but the croquettes we had were burnt on the outside and frozen in the middle... we sent them back and the waiter insisted on getting another portion, this time they came back extra black on the outside, but at least cooked in the middle   I liked the sangria though!"
The famous Bar restaurant,"I ate paella and puffo, and it was delicious. The octopus was so soft, and the combination of octopus and potatoes is amazing!! There is a lot of paella, so be careful!"

I went to the restaurant with the expectation that I would not find it, which was a pleasant surprise. I ate a squid and cod paella that was Spectacular, an atmosphere and good treatment by the owner, very attentive and friendly, I will surely return, a pleasant experience"
The famous Bar restaurant,"Champagne Sangria is a fairy tale good for small children. You sell wine from the supermarket and pretend that it is something special, and why is there no such price list on the menu? Why doesnt anyone inform you, because you know very well that you are wrong and lying. The owner is a parasite on uninformed tourists!!!!! 1 liter of sangri costs 24 euros. This is a rip off in broad daylight."
The famous Bar restaurant,"I didnt know what to order, so I asked, and they answered kindly! I was so happy to hear that seafood paella was available for one person!! I ordered paella and gambas, and they kindly froze the gambas, so I enjoyed them  And the paella was really, really delicious. They gave me sauce later, and I ate it with that, so it was delicious!! Lastly, I was so happy that they gave me two shot glasses as a service!! Next time I come to Barcelona, this is one of the restaurants I want to go to again!!"
The famous Bar restaurant,"After the Gaudi tour, I was looking for a highly rated local restaurant nearby to have lunch and found it! Highly recommended! I recommended it to my friends who traveled with me, and they said it was so delicious that they went twice! All the menu items I ate were delicious. Paella, fried red peppers, and gambas were delicious. And the sangria was full of fruit, so it was really delicious! I ate it outside, and it had a nice Spanish atmosphere. They say Spanish food is salty, but it wasnt salty at all and it was very delicious!"
The famous Bar restaurant,
The famous Bar restaurant,"five stars, no more to say!"
The famous Bar restaurant,"Good prices, good food, paella is not bad for being in such a touristy place, it lacked salt. They should have brought the starters before the seconds."

The famous Bar restaurant,"Stopped here for lunch before visiting the Sagrada Familia. The interior looks very deceiving, it looks very simple and small inside but the a pleasant surprise. Staff and service were fabulous & fast. Food was delicious and good portions. Prices were okay too for a touristy area Food"
The famous Bar restaurant,
The famous Bar restaurant,They didnt bring napkins. The food had small portions.
The famous Bar restaurant,"I went there because the ratings were good, but the stores photos show a lot of food, but the food is wrong... Im disappointed. Perhaps because the Sagrada Familia Cathedral is a tourist attraction, it is very expensive, and the food is not very good compared to the price. The owner is kind."
The famous Bar restaurant,"Pleasantly surprised by The Famous Restaurant!   Friendly welcome despite the austere decor and blinding lighting. The place was empty during our visit, but dont let that discourage you   the simplicity here is key.   Everything, though straightforward, is delicious without unnecessary embellishments. A great spot for local tapas!    Highly recommend this hidden gem!"
The famous Bar restaurant,"Quiet atmosphere and good cuisine, especially the paella which is great and the sangria from the house chapo"

The famous Bar restaurant,Very good service
The famous Bar restaurant,"The octopus in the paella was probably tender and flavorful, adding a delightful seafood element to the dish. The paella itself might have been aromatic, with a perfect balance of spices and flavors. Its a dish that combines the best of both worlds, showcasing the deliciousness of octopus and the traditional flavors of paella."

The famous Bar restaurant,One of the best restaurant
The famous Bar restaurant,I visited twice while in Barcelona! It was a perfect stop after seeing Sagrada Familia! The paella was really delicious
The famous Bar restaurant,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND, SCAM FOR TOURISTS! I dont usually write reviews, but I have to here because its been a long time since I left a restaurant so disgusted. No drinks card and astronomical prices on the bill. A liter jug of sangria costs 23.5 euros, and its the usual one from the supermarket with added fruit (apple and a few orange slices). When ordering any drink, you dont know how much you will pay for it. I have been to Spain many times, but I have never eaten worse Paela mixta. 4 shrimps and one shell, and the paela itself was the smallest Ive ever ordered (it cost almost 33 euros for two people). The paela had chicken meat with cartilage that was inedible. Additionally, the prices in the menu are given without tax (10%), which is then added to the bill. I DO NOT RECOMMEND, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."
The famous Bar restaurant,"Beware of this place! We just came out of there. Tempted by relatively good reviews, we went. How surprised we were when we saw the price of Paella -  32.90!!! Ok, we thought it was expensive, but probably worth it. We ordered. You could count the seafood on your fingers. The rest is some chicken with cartilage or other meat. It was paella mixta. Next  No drinks and drinks menu. We took sangria. One liter jug. Inside is ordinary wine from the supermarket with orange and apples. Price? Only  23.50. This was the absolute peak of our distaste for this place. Next... we take the bill... and there? 10% service fee added to the bill. God sweet people! I really understand that tourists, that they can be cut down, that prices can be higher. But let the quality go hand in hand with the price! This paella had no taste, we at least had to add salt to it. Apart from the fact that it was a portion for 1 person, max 1.5 people... Next door there is a bar full of locals, unfortunately we saw it after placing the order. Youre walking over there. Cheaper and better from what we can see. Dont make our mistake and fall for it. To the question Can we have the drink and drink menu please? The gentleman replied that they did not have any. Thats all. I had to, because I deserved it."
The famous Bar restaurant,
The famous Bar restaurant,Amazing place
The famous Bar restaurant,"I recently dined at this charming restaurant and was thoroughly impressed. The little sausages were a delightful appetizer, bursting with flavor. The Paella Mixta was a culinary masterpiece, perfectly blending a variety of ingredients. The sangria complemented the meal impeccably. The overall experience was elevated by impeccable service. A must-try for food enthusiasts!"

Perfect for those who want family time or couple time with nothing too fancy. Restaurant definitely has a community feeling and the food was presented hot and delicious. Will definitely visit if I go to Barcelona again
Chulo Restaurant,Excellent Nepali food. Very flavorful and balanced seasoning. Tried a bit of everything and it was all delicious and served promptly. Friendly and kind service. Everyone should definitely try if in Barcelona! Vegetarian options: Very delicious vegetarian food and plenty of options. Incredibly flavorful. Dietary restrictions: Great vegan and vegetarian options. Kid-friendliness: Great place for families.
Chulo Restaurant,
Chulo Restaurant,"Chulo really exceeded our expectations. The food was overall yummy but must highlight that every single item we ordered was really well cooked and flavoursome. We felt welcomed and really enjoyed the service and atmosphere. We even found out that it is a fully family owned restaurant, and you could really tell as it felt very authentic.  Overall, a 10 out of 10 experience!"
Chulo Restaurant,"We were a table of 13 with children and they treated us and recommended us very well. The food is good and they are very attentive. Maybe to put it a little bit expensive for the portions there are, but its the only thing I would change. Kid-friendliness: They gave us very good advice on what to order for the children."
Chulo Restaurant,Glad to have found an authentic Nepalese restaurant. The vibe was calm and homely. The food was tasty and super yummy. The owner is super friendly and sweet. We highly recommend this restaurant to everyone to get to know the taste and culture of Nepal.
Chulo Restaurant,
Chulo Restaurant,"Very good food, everything we ordered was delicious and the staff was very friendly, in a chill atmosphere. I 100% recommend the Jhol momo, they are incredible! I will be back Vegetarian options: Various vegetarian dishes"

Chulo Restaurant,Excellent Nepalese/ Indian food in Barcelona.
Chulo Restaurant,"Interesting place with Neopolitan cuisine. Friendly service. Delicious food, if you like Indian cuisine, you will most likely like it here."

Chulo Restaurant,
Chulo Restaurant,perfect
Chulo Restaurant,"For a mid-scale restaurant this place is everything you need for a little asian flavor. Left extremely full after ordering 2 plates of mixed momo s, sag paneer, biryani, naan, curry and samosas. The place is a family run establishment with a female chef and her husband as the front of house. A cozy place that is relaxed with beer on draft and simples spanish wines to pair. Make sure not to forget to order the samosas, vindaloo, momos and the HOT SAUCE which is super yummy.   Good for dine in or better yet get it to go for an even chiller evening."
Chulo Restaurant,So we tried Nepali cuisine for the very first time and we loved it. Food was delicious and service was very fast and super friendly.
Chulo Restaurant,"We were here today evening for our dinner and their foods are delicious. This is not an indian cuisine but nepalese cuisine. We orderd a pork curry and a chicken curry with basmathi rice and roti and beer, white wine and two masala teas. It was delicious and portion is only for one person.I recommend this place.photos like same. But one dish is chicken and one dish is pork."
Chulo Restaurant,Absolutely fantastic delicious food. Great spicy stuff. Flavorful.
Chulo Restaurant,"There was no one, it was very cold in the place, we ordered Samosa Chana Chat, and they brought it to us crumbled, without knowing what we were eating. Next Chicken Tikka Masala which was tasteless with no flavor and the chicken was dry and tough. Besides you have to order rice. Praw Biryani, with prawns the only thing that was good. We will not return again."
Chulo Restaurant,"The restaurant staff is very nice and the food was very delicious. The only point to improve would be that it took them a while to get the food out. However, the wait was compensated by the quality (you can see very homemade food). Vegetarian options: There were various vegetarian options."
Chulo Restaurant,"Delicious food, great service, and vibe! Highly recommend."
Chulo Restaurant,Had the most delicious chicken choila outside of Nepal! The owner was very nice and kind. He even gave us chiura for free with the appetizer. The momos were also good. It just made my day.

Chulo Restaurant,"There was a group of eight of us that came for a late lunch and they were super accommodating, extremely friendly and patient. The service was incredibly fast and the food was absolutely phenomenal. My daughter found and suggested this place because she s a vegetarian and there were plenty of delicious options for her. My youngest is a picky eater and she tried and ate everything which says a lot. We started with both the Samosa Chana Chat and Samosas which were wonderful. My nephew ordered the Dal soup and everyone at the table loved it. The paneer was great the chicken vindaloo was amazing. Everything we ordered was perfect. There was a good amount of spice (spiciness) which I really appreciated (Indian restaurants where I live hold the spice for white people haha). Everything about this place was great. If you re craving some Nepalese or Indian food in Barcelona, I highly recommend this place, we absolutely loved it."
Chulo Restaurant,Good place and good attention from the waiters and very pleasant place I recommend
Chulo Restaurant,"Excellent Nepali restaurant, the food is an explosion of flavors, and if it is your first time trying this cuisine, Mukesh will help you choose the best options. I recommend it and I will surely return!"

Chulo Restaurant,
Chulo Restaurant,"This place has improved a lot, before it was a place called Miloka that was a drag bar, today it is a multicultural place, homemade food and excellent service but with the same customers who monopolize the television to watch football and dont let me watch my Netflix series."
Chulo Restaurant,"Delicious food! Tthis was the first time we tried Nepalese cuisine and we hit it perfectly in Barcelona. Mo-mo very tasty, delicate, delicious, heaven in the mouth. Lamb delicious. Also try Gourk - Nepalese beer, without bitterness which I like very much. The owner more then very nice, very polite guy. Communicative, entertained us with interesting conversation.  He knows very well how to serve customers perfectly. Very nice place to stop and rest, quiet, atmospheric. You want to be there. We hope to visit Chullo again. Thank you !

Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,The staff is nice and friendly. We ate a gaspacho and chicken paella and it was very tasty.
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Truly awful, beautifully presented food heated up In The microwave until its a piece of rubber, then they try to overcharge you for it too! Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere.  Not bad service tho, the waiter was quite obviously used to people complaining about the food and the bill."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Place to avoid.....
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Very good place, everything very clean and the food very good"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Very basic for the prices they have and very slow.... Too slow.... I notice how I get old between dishes
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Be especially careful with this store, specialized in scamming tourists!!! Prices go down, trying to take photos to document their arrogant service. The waiter will also take the red wine scissors from the tourists and will also steal the tourists phones!!!!!!!!! Carefully!!!"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Je me joins aux avis negatifs sur cet endroit. Vraiment decu La salade sentais mauvais ca se voit qu elle date de tres tot le matin voir d hier. Les gambas sans gouts. La pizza c etait l huile qui a fait deborder le vase. Mauvais restaurant.. ca se voit ils ne pensent qu a l argent. L endroit n est pas super propre aussi. Y avait des client qui criaient trop fort c etait desagreable. Et ce n est pas le bon endroit pour prendre une paella   aussi Mauvaise experience Je deconseille

Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"To flee ! Tourist trap! 5.4e for a coke, 13.50 for a pizza with a topping as light as a cloud and uncooked dough. In short, go further..."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,The croissant is spectacular.
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"your arm stays glued to the table because its so annoying, the Brother brings me some spaghetti bolognese and ends up forcing you to pay in cash, a really lame atmosphere and not at all welcoming. I advise against"

Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Very scary experience, if you want to keep yourself safe then you should not come to this restaurant"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Very hungry, we made the mistake of going in without looking at the reviews. Horrible service, grumpy waiter, we asked if we could eat the buffet (he made it clear that it was in the price) and when he arrived he started saying in an arrogant tone the price of every single food. The fact is that that night I vomited 8 times and got dysentery while eating seafood Paella. To be avoided. In the end we paid 92 euros to eat nothing and feel bad!"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"APPALLING. A coke  5.40? I do not recommend. Brothy paella, bad taste, DISGUSTING. Arrogant and dirty service. Toilet with cockroaches. A shame. 100 euros in the trash."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"As for Basque tapas, it says nothing at all, if a Basque goes hell have a heart attack....all the tapas are frozen, even the tortilla de pata from the market. 4.85 euros a tap cola... No comment"

The other restricted options, based on pasta (brand and pizza), there is also paella. We ordered 6 croquettes and paid  22. The bill was  90 for three people. This area of the city is one of the most touristy and expensive."

Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Walk-in to this tapas restaurant, with excitement. Lots of tapas presentation at the counter bar. Ordered a carbonara, a small tapas & sauteed mushrooms   it was lousy. The pasta was tasteless with pathetic pieces of bacon. It cost Euro 27. Shld have read the reviews before stepping in"

Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Waqas best in Barcelona! Amazing tapas
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,The waiter tried to overcharge us. The bartender serves reluctantly. They should learn to serve customers well.
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"I will save sharing my experience, the comments says it all."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"BE CAREFUL .. DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WORST RESTAURANT AND SERVICE IN BARCELONA!!! If you want to have the worst paella, enjoy the worst service, and have an angry waiter who lies about everything, you are in the right place."

Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,An expensive and low quality place.
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"When I read the comments I was already seated and we had already ordered the food, friendliness is not the strong point of some of the staff, there was one who initially welcomed us who was friendly, then whoever came next at the beginning was a little friendly. Regarding the food, the Paella was very good and the Polvo A Galega was too spicy. So it didnt go bad."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Terrible experience and really poor food. Very high prices for what we ate, poor service"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"A fuir !!! Nous arrivons pour commander 5 cocas et 5 paellas. Les cocas arrivent en 2 minutes. La paella met 1h a arriver. Nous refusons de payer les paellas avant qu elles arrivent et la surprise ! La police arrive et nous dit vous payez pas on vous embarquent ! Nous ne refuson en aucun cas de payer nous refusons juste de consomme (nous etions pret a payer et aller donner les paellas au pauvre sdf). Et pour coronner le tout, les personnes qui nous force a acheter les gadgets et le personnel qui rit avec eux !!!!"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,A fuir !!! Il sont vraiment irrespectueux avec les clients font venir la police alors qu on leurs a juste demander de payer sans manger puisqu une heure pour attendre il faut pas deconner ! Et en plus on ce fait racoler par des gens qui vendes des choses il ne font rien ! Vraiment des fous !!!!
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Irrespectueux avec les clients, 40min pour un service, rabattage intensif des personnes autour du restaurant, une honte"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"We got 2 breakfasts with 2 eggs 4sausages and one with potatoes 1 coffee and 1 orange juice we paid 2 x 7 euros for breakfast 1x1.80 the coffee So far, thats all 6 euros for fresh juice ???? I found it too expensive compared to the other themes."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Was charged 6x for one serving of meatballs. They didn t accept card, only cash. Avoid this scam. Awful food. Dont order patatas bravas, they have no seasoning or flavour. Similarly, the mushrooms were bland and simply bad. There are many, many nice restaurants close by. Don t make our mistake, do more research"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Not letting the awful experience taint my judgment of the food. The food was presented amazingly, however it was overcooked thereby making it rubbery. Now with the horrible service and attempted thievery: We ordered the large seafood platter with added lobster, seabream, plain bread, and the black rice paella. The server asked us if we wanted anything to drink, mentioned sangria was  4.50 so we got 1 glass. We asked to see a drink menu but the server instead started listing drinks out. After asking a bunch of questions about the drinks, he told us that a bottle of their house wine would be *thinks for a second, finally goes and pulls up the drink menu which is at a stand behind our table*  18...here on the menu. We were confused as to why he didnt just show us the menu, but we went ahead and ordered the bottle of house wine. When the server repeated the order back to us he repeated seabass and I corrected him that we ordered sea bream. He acknowledged this and left to place our order. What we actually got was NOT seabream, it was a tiny fish (see picture). Bread had not come, another server came by so we told him we were still waiting on bread that we ALREADY ORDERED. Everything went fine until the bill came. The second server dropped it off and said to me Tip not included. -- not an issue, 15% tip is normal where I live. I checked the bill, as I often do before I pay. They overcharged on the wine, the sangria, and charged 3 orders of bread: 2 tomato and 1 plain. We told the server who dropped off the bill that we had only ordered 1 bread so it was obviously an error. He interrupted us and said, Ok can I explain first? He insisted that he asked if it was plain or tomato. HE SAID that he asked if the bread was for everyone at the table. **In actuality, this was never asked. He only kept asking tomato bread -- we said plain multiple times. My dad just agreed to the tomato bread, and the server left our table.* I told him we only placed 1 order of bread. He insisted we received 2 because 1 order is only 3 pieces and we received 6 pieces of bread. This was NEVER specified. He continued arguing with us and eventually literally grabbed the bill and said, Fine if you dont want to pay it I will take it off the bill. We said, Yes, thank you. He came back with SUCH an attitude. We asked about the sangria and he said nobody told us the sangria was  4.50. Odd, because he wasnt our initial server. Then he wouldnt allow me to see the total on the machine and demanded I tap the card. He argued with my husband that he would not allow us to hold the machine to pay. He had a DEATH GRIP on the machine as if we were going to run away with it. It was a complete farce. This whole situation was causing a total scene and everyone in the restaurant was staring. My husband said can you bring the machine closer I cant see. He said THEN GO CHECK YOUR EYES. What kind of service is this?! My husband yelled that we were trying to pay and the server hilariously said, No WE are paying YOU. It wouldve been great if they paid us to eat there, but instead they were trying to overcharge us. This server yelled at me twice because the total was over  100 so I needed to insert the card and type in my PIN. He said I cancelled the payment when really it was the fact that I needed to insert my card, which I couldnt anyways since he was holding the machine hostage. Finally, he held out the machine for me to insert the card -- DID NOT LET GO -- and made me stretch over to type in the PIN. I asked for his supervisory or manager and he hilariously claimed that he was the manager. Ok, buddy. Good effort trying to overcharge and steal from us, amazing job making yourself look like a fool to the rest of the guests. If I could give negative stars, I would."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Very expensive and a glass of bottled Pepsi for  5. Not recommended.
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"I went to this restaurant with my friends. The welcome from the waiter was very grumpy. While we waited for our paella, the staff passed by the room with the waste bins. We ordered 3 prawns as a starter at the price of  10.50. The inedible looking paella had good fish but no comment on the rest."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Oh my god, so many bad comments, maybe Im not competent to comment because we only ate curosas, if I had read the reviews I would certainly not have entered this place and probably would have regretted it, we happened to want to try curosas on the first day of our stay and they were phenomenal , we went to other places and they were not like here, the man behind the sledge was quite ok and kind, the place is nice and in a good place, its a shame for a restaurant like this to have such poor reviews, Im glad I didnt have a bad experience"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"We actually love this place. The people are great. Our guy remembered us from our trip last year. The food is good, I had the meatballs, and my wife had the shrimp and cucumber salad. We also had the chicken kebab. Sangria was great."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Very bad service, bad attitude from the waiters. Do not disturb your mood with such bad people and worse service."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"First the positive, the food was delicious The negative thing about paying was that the waiters only wanted to accept cash. After a short discussion we could pay by card The ambience is very nice Prices are okay according to the location"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Do NOT go in here if you want to be betrayed. Most expensive chicken nuggets ($2.50 PER piece) and kids food you will ever buy for your 5 year old. For reference, my son had 6 pieces of chicken nuggets, 7 fried cheeseballs (the size of a chocolate candy ball... $2.50 each... that means my 35 lbs kid ate about a 35 euro kids meal) my husband and I shared a plate of fried foods (fried tapas with EACH individual item costing $3.50). Definitely a tourist trap and if you want to feel sad and ripped off and betrayed at the same time, thats how you will feel after going here."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"They haunt you as you pass by, invite you to the place, and then leave you to your fate. Service is bad, comes late. The place smells bad. Most importantly, it is very expensive. Price/performance is very bad. I think its a place to stay away from. The calamari was sticky nicely. Pizza is okay. Kid-friendliness: Not"
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"De passage a Barcelone, nous avons mange dans ce restaurant. Restaurant avec des prix exorbitants, boissons non presentes sur la carte (11  une biere et 5 50 un coca). Prix different selon votre emplacement (interieur ou exterieur). Les serveurs ne sont pas tres aimable, et de plus, a la fin du repas on vous demande de payer en espece a plusieurs reprises alors que nous souhaitions regler par carte  Seul point positif, la paella mixte est tres bonne."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Tres surprenant et tres nul ! Apres un accueil moyen et un repas surveille en permanance par le serveur, la note a ete tres Salee  : plus de 200  pour quelques tapas. Cest un attrape touristes et si vous demandez la note detaillee, accrochez vous car vous naurez rien. On etait a 2 doigts dappeler la police. Aucun prix clair et lardoise est trop confuse ! Etablissement a fuir ++++++."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Delicious tapas, super delicious paella and excellent house wine. The service was excellent. I dont understand the bad reviews about the service. I recommend it to everyone. Excellent experience."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"The food is okay, but is too expensive to pay a soft drink for  5,40."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"I was in this place with my wife during our vacations. When we get in, I was approached for a guys extremely rude asking me to use the counter instead of a table to have my meal. I ve asked he why and he said it shouldn t be taken over table and haven t give us any reason why. Wondering if the fact of my wife and I be a black couple was the reason we couldn t have our meal using a table. I don t recommend this place for anyone. We have to keep strong against any racism actions we may suffer."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Delicious food! We are picky eaters but the seasoning was spot on.
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"Nul, nul et nul...rien de bien dans ce resto ! Menu du jour a 15 ...sans dessert et restrictions sur les boissons. Bruyant et toilettes sales. Allez ailleurs."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,"By far the most expensive tapas we ate on vacation. Had 6 small tapas and 3 cokes and ended up spending over  85. Then they just wanted cash, strangely there is a big Visa sign on the door? When I asked how the price came about, the waiter listed something that was incomprehensible. We didnt get an invoice after asking several times. In the end the most expensive and worst meal on our vacation."
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Danger! Absolute tourist trap. So far the worst and most expensive meal we had in Barcelona. We feel ripped off!!
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,A super paella in a shaded and cool place with maximum kindness
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,Excellent paella in a characteristic and welcoming environment
Restaurant Salsalada barra&bar,You expect to pay a premium in this area but  9.50 for a large pepsi... Absolutely rip off
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Absolute tourist trap. The waiters were unfriendly and unmotivated. For a starter we ordered fried squid, but we couldnt eat it because it wasnt crunchy but full of fat. The lasagne was still frozen on the inside, truly unbelievable. The pasta was overcooked and the cheese sauce was burnt and strangely lumpy. The  cook  really doesn t seem to have any demands on himself."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Horrible service. Forget orders even when it s slow and really don t care about you. Food was bad. Half the fries were cooked half totally raw on the same plate.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,The food not bad but not great as well
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Staff was yelling at when we first arrived. As for the music, they kept skipping songs and volume kept changing. Food here is either adequate or not good. My friend had a completely uncooked piece of ravioli in her dish. chicken nuggets have zero flavor and were overpriced. I am not a picky at all and I would not chose to eat here again."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Owner rude to customers and employees, forcing employees to kick customers off the terrace or having to order food. I was on the terrace for 10 minutes and they came several times to ask if I was sure I didnt want to eat, if I didnt want to eat I would have to leave the terrace. I just finished the drink and left, terrible."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,The food was delicious
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Nice place, delicious food. Very friendly people"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"AVOID!!!! Horrendous food. If youre peckish after your visit to Parc Guell, walk further, trust me. Food : 1/5"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Very unfortunately, this is the worst restaurant I have encountered in Spain. Terrible service attitude, very salty, deceptive food. My parents and I came here after the park in the morning, because there was no signal on the Internet, and the menu price seemed reasonable at the door, but then it turned out that it was indeed a very bad restaurant. At first, the waiter gave me the charge for water without confirming it, and I asked for the word free many times, but he didnt understand the word, until I used a translation software to inform me that the water here needs to be charged. The food was even more surprising, it was completely different from the menu photos, very casual and tasted terrible, and we ordered shrimp and had several mouthfuls of salt! Is this the taste buds of Spain? And the bad thing is that we found that the table was different from everyone else, there was no paper on the mat, which would not be convenient for storing food scraps. After we talked to the waiter, he threw the paper with a very bad face, and even picked up the plate and threw it heavily in front of my mother. I felt angry, but there was nothing I could do. By sharing my bad experience, I can give a reminder to future tourists, and I hope you will not affect the mood of the trip."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,The meat wasnt good so it was overcooked and the tomatoes tasted like grass.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"This place should be closed !  Ordered ravioli, ate only few peaces, because it was dicussting, I thought it is not cooked well, but now it obvious that ravioli was from another century, because even from few bites I got a FOOD POISONING ! That really destroyed my next day in Barcelona. I was happy only about one thing, that other family members didnt got it, even the food was very poor quality."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Their menu is frozen food. Food is not prepared in the restaurant. The menu photos have nothing to do with what they serve you. Not in terms of quantity and much less in quality. They charged us extra to sit on the terrace and they never let us know. We ordered drinks and they forgot. The waiter is good, but try to talk to the chef and he doesnt know how to deal with a customer, denied and closed to the fact that his food presented on the table was exactly the same as the one in the photo, totally false!!! Apart from the terrible food"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Restaurant located at Parc Guell Just down the street. Nice ambience. The service is friendly. Price-wise its okay. We had a small pizza for  9.90 and various pastas for  8.90 each. We all enjoyed it
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Carlos, the waiter who served us, was quite friendly and attentive to us. Good service. It is close to Park Guell, the food arrived quickly and hot. Very good quality price, it has the 3 bs: good, pretty and cheap."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,The worst food I ever eat . Don t go there  the food can kill you
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Friendly and helpful staff, freshly prepared food, everything really delicious! The best paella we ate in Barcelona"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Friendly staff and delicious dishes, all delicious and fresh fish! Congratulations to all the staff, I highly recommend!"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Food basically frozen and heated to serve (bravas and pizza for example). A small water 3 euros. Big scam. A shame
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Excellent restaurant. The waiters are so friendly. Delicious food, demanding serving. Come and have a lunch or dinner her, you won t regret it! We ate here with our family, we were 5 together and got a table immediately. Vegetarian options: There are vegetarian options"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Fine taste!
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Service was fine, very friendly staff, but food was very bad."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"This place destroys the idea of good Spanish cuisine, a diner in which there is nothing normal, only disgusting perverted dishes, a pathetic semblance, made without a soul. The coffee is horrible too, I dont recommend this place! Vegetarian options: Despite the fact that there is a dish for vegetarians, it is better to look for another place."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"They served us the main dish before the starter, and even though we warned them several times, it took them more than half an hour to serve the starter, when the first dish was already cold. They didnt even apologize."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,The food was yummy!
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Typical tourist trap, food is tasteless, best to skip..."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Worst place ever. Do not step in
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Great Food!
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"I was hungry on my way back from Park Guell and stopped by for some tapas, but the delivery time from ordering was quick and the taste was perfect. The deluxe potatoes were especially popular with children."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Amasing tasty delicious fresh fishes in addition foods. Definitely you must give a try! Attentive waiters and waitresses are really kind! Food
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Good service
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Small portions for the price and the quality of the ingredients in some dishes were really low (cheapest frozen food from the supermarket)
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Food for  13, frozen from Kaufland for  2, I dont recommend it"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"The pick is good, if it wasnt frozen from Kaufland for  12, maybe it would be better"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Do not go there, Staff doesnt speak english, in november they didnt want to close door and it was very cold and at the end payment couldnt be splitted. Food - so so."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"The service is incredible and welcoming, they have hours of promotions like free drinks and the taste of the food is delicious  . I would definitely return."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Do you know the episode of Spongebob Squarepants where the crab cakes were with cement? The food there was exactly the same.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"The waiter was friendly and speaks good English. The food was a little warm, apparently the grill had accumulated some coal, but the food itself was fresh and tasty. The room is well checked, beautiful picture."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Paella absolutely tasteless and portions not much Tourist trap - I really dont recommend
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Friendly waiters, but mediocre food, in addition to having hake in poor condition and with a very bad smell, I do not recommend it."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Freeze food
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Everything is mediocre. I drank cappuccino, ate Greek salad, fish, churros. Dont be lazy and go to the next restaurant."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"The experience with the dishes is very poor, tough meat, a Galician-style octopus for 18 euros with a portion almost like a childrens menu, bitter vegetables, 0 recommended and they brought us cans of soda that arrived with stains."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Serveurs agreables et attentionnes. Nous avons passe un agreable moment en famille pour tester les tapas. Les sardines et calamars etaient bons mais les tapas au poulet decevants.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Very tasty food, incredibly fast service, cheap prices!"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Very bad service, I do not recommend it"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Food is below average but the place is nice.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Nice restaurant with excellent service and good food. Perfect price for restaurants next to a teacher park Guell.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,DO NOT EAT HERE. Place is pretty nice and very close the park but food was horrible.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"When he heard us speak in Catalan, the boss was happy, because the place seems only for guiris. Excellent tapas, reasonable prices and superior service. We will be back!!!"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,I liked it
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Normal experience, there were no problems, it is a casual restaurant-bar, I would not recommend it to foreigners, there are better options, the food is normal, very casual, what you would do at home and in a very short time, its cons are that the food It takes a long time, the food seems to be frozen and bought from the supermarket and its costs are super high. The only one who serves well is a girl named Leticia, very friendly."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Excellent service and the best cava sangria in the world
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,The worst restaurant and not nice service
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,I dont recommend
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Worst food in Barcelona
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"the worst stuff Ive seen, a ball of meat that was basically just batter, sent back because it was frozen in the center and returned just as I left it. Paella with disgusting fish and everything clearly frozen. A huge hair in the paella for free."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Very poor service Cold food
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"I ordered squid and this is what they brought me, only one waiter was willing to work, high prices, if you are around here I do not recommend this place"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"I literally had to ask the manager: Do you want me to buy you something or not? He made it extremely clear that he wanted us to leave at a quarter past because he had to leave at half past. The education was conspicuous by its absence... the waiters and waitresses were nice, but the experience was quite mediocre. I do not recommend it."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"terrible experience, high prices and terrible quality. rude waiter who gets offended if you dont leave your paycheck in his restaurant, shame on you. Plus they lied to us about the price!"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Good restaurant near Park Guell. Prices adequate to the location and quality of food. There are many dishes to choose from, including: pasta, risotto, pizza, salads and grilled meat dishes. In our case, it was ravioli al pesto, risotto, tuna salad and grilled chicken. Additionally, good drinks and a large selection of desserts. Helpful service. There is also wifi in the premises."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,9 two watered down coffees and two 0.5l waters. Practically a theft.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Assez bien dans l ensemble. Les plats sont un peu eleves et trop peu copieux.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,No air-condition
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Really my worst experience in Spain in a one week visit. Bad food and poor service. We do not recommend to waste your money at this place. A few steps down the street, there are many other options."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Unfriendly staff, drinks are served in disposable plastic cups. There were 5 of us, we ordered tapas as a starter and then a main course. The main course came first and the tapas came in between. Not everyone got the main course at the same time (in fact, there was a lot of time in between). The pastas were reheated, little taste Really not recommended!!!!"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Never go there!!! I was there this evening. I said to the waiter we want to start with tapas. He also asked if we wanted to order a main course. We ordered pasta as a main course and tapas as an appetizer. Olives were warm and without taste. Croquettes were not fresh and attacked. Calamars greasy and fried. Bravas not edible due to too much tabasko. Our main courses came first, and in the middle of our main course we got the tapas. The pasta was reheated and not fresh at all.... Service was rude. Prices are not cheap compared to the quality. For me 0/10"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"De passage pour une petite pause tapas avant daller visiter le parc Guell, nous avons pu gouter plusieurs plats. On ny vient pas pour manger les meilleurs tapas de Barcelone mais on y trouve son compte quand meme. Les prix sont contenus et le service agreable. Un bon endroit pour une petite pause"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"We have eaten two paellas and they were exquisite, plus they have a very refreshing 1 liter beer, we will definitely return"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Je vous en supplie ny allez surtout pas ! Je viens dy aller avec ma petite famille, nous avons depenser au moins 98euro pour une nourriture degueulasse crevette surgeles, pizza surgeles, pate surgeles, saumon surgeles, dorade surgeles, frite pas fris, serveuse qui se trompe dadditions, serveur pas du tout aimable meme pas un merci aurevoir aucune politesse... Restaurant pas du tout chaleureux ! Lappat est tres  bien faite devant avec leur affiche a nourriture... Jai mange kebap avec ma petite famille au moins jai paye 40euro mais serveur et caissier tres aimable. Alors je vous prie de ne meme pas mettre un pied vous allez jete votre argent a la poubelle"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Weve been waiting for more than 30 minutes, but the foods still havent served. We had to complaint 3 times just to get us our drinks, and its not that good. Very not recommended"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Excellent service, atmosphere and the food was the best, very typical food in Spain."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"The food was delicious, the service was very pleasant, the pizzas and potatoes were the best."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Les tapas ne sont pas faits maison, c est certain, mais ils restent bons. Le service fut rapide et agreable. Le lieu est propre et calme. Pratique, simple, bon."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Do not cheat. What it looks like: basic food. But you are close to Park Guell and you have to eat something
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"ATTRAPE TOURISTE (A eviter) Les visuels ne donnent pas envie. Nous avons meme hesite a repartir des le debut mais par respect nous sommes tout de meme reste. A l apero : Nous avons commande des boissons arrivant dans des verres en plastique. Une coupe de sangria mettant 15 minutes a arriver par rapport au reste. Les plats : Ensuite nous avons commande des plats differents : -1 Pizza -1 Paella au riz Noir -1 Salade -1 Burger La pizza est clairement une pizza congelee de supermarche. La paella est arrivee lorsque nous avions tous fini de manger (nous pensions que notre ami avait ete oublie) La salade ressemble a des salades de supermarche. Le burger etait passable. Pour couronner le tout, le personnel n est pas aimable. Bref a totalement eviter !!!!"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"ATTRAPE TOURISTE ! A eviter ! Nous avons ete y manger avant daller au Parc Guell. Les visuels ne donnent pas envie, les plats sont dune qualite plus que mediocre et ma paella au riz noir est arrivee apres tout le monde. Les Coca ont ete servis avec des verres en plastique. De plus, pour couronner le tout, une partie du personnel netait pas aimable"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Very good paellas, politeand friendly staff."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"The food was disgusting and took 45 minutes to arrive. The chicken was horrible, the pasta toooo! I highly suggest you run away from this restaurant."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Not good food, small portions. The menu options are very uninspired and limited, the execution even worse. However, for being this close to park Guell it is very cheap and the atmosphere is not bad."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Ah, 2 euros, beer 3 euros, churros 4 euros. It looks like a good place to rest and recharge after a tour. Affordable price for 2 people. Spacious space."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Really cool atmosphere, they handled my poor spanish really well   Food was quite yummy and prices really fair. Perfect after day at Park Guell We ordered: seafood paella, pasta with seafood, grilled squids and churros with chocolate. Squids were one of the best we ate ever    to drink we had mojito, beer and cava sangria - all nice. Young servers that have really chill attitude . Would highly recommend Wheelchair accessibility: Places outside are available, could be a bit tight. To get inside there are three steps, no ramp available."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Everything is really good. Atmosphere, Food and music. Highly recommended"
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"It took 45 min for my dish to arrive, everyone in my party ate before me. Not even a coffee for free after so long waiting. My food was way too salty, do not recommend calamari or squid I do not recommend it. They took too long to serve and forgot one of the peoples dish. The cuttlefish was too salty. Place for tourists only."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Even though I ordered paella, it didnt arrive for 30 minutes. Even the salad took 20 minutes. Moreover, the store wasnt crowded and there were only about 2 other customers. This is terrible for a tourist spot."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Service is the worst. Pizza is good
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Terrible experience, 20min to get our order and poor quality. Please dont waste your time or money, this a tourist trap and not worth at all. Waiter didnt even worried to take our order we had to stand up and for our stuff.. Sincerely, the worst place ever."
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,Bad restaurant. Do not think that what you eat here is the real flavors.
Mercedes Restaurant Tapas-Bar,"Unfortunately, bad experience, food from a semi-finished product. A portion of mussles is very very small for the price. I do not recommend ."

Fu Xing,"A waiter that serves properly, a lost art. The food could be more fresh, but one understands it goes with the price. OG Chinese flavour. I wish you success and please take care of that fish in the tank."
Fu Xing,"Edit: After the owners absurd response. Through the Globo service. And you know this perfectly, because you deliver the order to the delivery people. (I ordered delivery. Quality/price ratio 2/5. Adding a lot of oil or a lot of industrial sauce does not help.)"
Fu Xing,
Fu Xing,Good food and exquisite service
Fu Xing,"I work next door and today for the first time I came to eat with my family and I was surprised by the food, it is great, nothing like the typical flavors of a Chinese restaurant. What is true is that if you are in a hurry or are impatient I do not recommend it, although the wait is worth 1000!!!! We will be back!!!! Dietary restrictions: They ask you to notify if you have any intolerance"
Fu Xing,"Missed Chinese food after 2 weeks in Spain, so decided to try this restaurant on our last night in Spain. The food here is very reasonably priced and with very nice and authentic taste. Found out that the people running the restaurant were from the southern Chinese province of Fujian. I liked the dishes we ordered, especially the oyster beef. If you want cheap and good Chinese food in Barcelona, i highly recommend this place."
Fu Xing,Incredible chinese food!!
Fu Xing,"Very tasty food!!! The prices of the dishes encourage you to use this restaurant. The guy serving in the room deserves praise and respect for his work, his contribution to his work and behavior. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat tasty food and sit in peace."
Fu Xing,"Affordable, delicious, good attitude"
Fu Xing,too delicious! The taste of missing you.
Fu Xing,

Fu Xing,Amazing Tallarines top!!! Food
Fu Xing,"Very good restaurant, very good and very friendly"
Fu Xing,"I usually go a lot since the food is enviable. Regarding the daily menu, it is very good. But without a doubt the unique dishes make an incredible difference. I have had the pleasure of meeting the cook and the waiter and they are excellent people with an unparalleled education. I personally recommend it without hesitation. Emphasize that the unique dishes are amazing and the prices, nothing to object to. Congratulations. It is a real pleasure to have a corner of such quality."
Fu Xing,Exquisite food at a very good price. The unbeatable service.
Fu Xing,"Not far from the Sagrada Familia, it satisfied our Chinese taste. Because I had to catch a flight, I ordered 3 noodles and a bowl of soup. The food was served quickly, delicious, and the price was super affordable. The service is also great"
Fu Xing,"Very good service, very friendly and good food! I went with my whole family for Three Kings Day and we will repeat :)"

The rest is so so so 3 bottles of Tsingtao All in all, 45 euros is great value for money haha. I actually cried while eating it. /////////////////////////////////////////////// Came once more today I packed it I ordered 1 noodle, 1 egg soup, and sweet and sour pork. A total of 17 euros Personally, I think these three menus are the main ones. If it were in front of my house, I would probably go four times a week."
Fu Xing,"Very good food, friendly and prompt staff."
Fu Xing,Best bang for your buck in the area!

Fu Xing,"Thank you for your help on a regular basis. Mainly stir-fried dishes and gyoza dishes, but all menu items are consistently delicious. Recommended dishes include boiled dumplings, stir-fried white fish or chicken with sweet and sour vinegar, etc. Also, beer lovers will be very happy if they serve the beer glass perfectly chilled. I can cry. The guy in charge of the floor is very kind and makes you feel comfortable, so Ive been coming here all the time."
Fu Xing,"Is there really a restaurant like this hidden away? Since my accommodation is nearby, I passed by a few times... I suddenly wanted to go in. Wow...so delicious It was delicious so I ordered more. If you dont like adult food, you can come here and eat. 100% guaranteed The rice looks delicious, but I couldnt eat it... + If you are tired of waiting in the land of waiting, please come. It came out so fast. i love it......."
Fu Xing,Fast and freshly made. Also an excellent quality-price ratio. Without a doubt to repeat.
Fu Xing,
Fu Xing,"Good, pretty, cheap,. Friendly staff and very delicious food"
Fu Xing,"We went because of the reviews but they have nothing to do with it. There are better Chinese restaurants than this. The spring rolls are tiny (in the photo they come out big), the Chinese noodles have no flavor at all..."
Fu Xing,The best Chinese restaurant in the area.
Fu Xing,"To eat lunch menu, very complete and very good, with homemade spicy sauce, and excellent price in relation to the good quality of the food, there is only one waiter but he is very effective with all the tables and very friendly, highly recommended and for totally come back, its a shame I dont live in Barcelona but when I come back, we will come back"
Fu Xing,"I came here when I was tired of Spanish food. It reminds me of the taste I had in China when I was studying abroad. Im eating well. I went to KFC in Spain because I wanted to eat chicken and was so disappointed, but the chicken wings here are much better (the sauce is just chili sauce). Dont misunderstand that the large amount of rice in the photo means the rice was put to one side."
Fu Xing,"I used to live right across the street and whenever I was too lazy to cook I would order takeout. Today I live on the other side of the city and I continue doing the same thing... It is the best Chinese restaurant in Barcelona, and with the midday menu it is super well priced. No matter where I live, I will always come back for the beef with onion."
Fu Xing,"Great but great Chinese restaurant, excellent food, tasty fresh and homemade spicy sauce, great service, lastly when I complimented him on the food he told me that his father cooked, it was obvious, he automatically gained a customer. Ill be back soon."

Fu Xing,"Little hidden gem in Barcelona! We were looking for a place to eat quickly so we could continue with our trip and we found this small restaurant. Inside there is space for about 6 tables and outside there are two more. When we arrived, we were greeted by the waiter who, although he was quite busy, served us very well. There is a daily three-course menu for  11.95 which is very good. The dishes are not delicatessen, but they are really good. I would repeat without hesitation, congratulations."
Fu Xing,The food didn t look like much on the menu pictures but when we got the dishes they were really tasty! Really good value and well cooked! Friendly staff.
Fu Xing,"friendly staff, large portion, good price and quality, very tasty. I recommend! Food"
Fu Xing,"Authentic Chinese flavor, attentive service, enormous portions for a decent price - can totally recommend!"
Fu Xing,"We were here as a family with 3 children, everyone loved the food. Delicious dishes, freshly prepared. Not a long waiting time. Reasonable prices"
Fu Xing,"Delicious Cantonese food. The restaurant is run by a Fujian family. All the food is served hot and spicy. One of the fried chicken wings was so delicious that I forgot to take a photo The waiters were attentive and polite. Among the Chinese restaurants in the past few days, this one is the most worthy of recommendation"
Fu Xing,"Tres bon restaurant... Excellente cuisine , pas cher et servie copieusement ... 2 boissons ( biere + the glace), une entree ( 4 nems ), 2 plats ( nouilles aux gambas + riz frit poulet ) , 2 accompagnements ( poulet frit + saute de gambas sel et poivre ) a 33 eur pour 2 personnes Serveur tres sympathique...

Fu Xing,A very basic and average Chinese restaurant. Food was good. Restaurant was looking dark and boring. A little music would do the trick.
Fu Xing,the beef and onions along with rice is a secret. its really good. The owner is super nice as well.
Fu Xing,good value for money. friendly service. a pleasant experience recommended
Fu Xing,
Fu Xing,"Excellent place to enjoy their daily three-course menu with drinks and dessert included. Small but cozy. A very good price and pleasant service. Also with details that are appreciated, such as the bowl with ice when you order, as in my case, Coffee with ice and the fact that they give you a drink, if you ask for it, a Tsingtao beer at no added cost to the menu."
Fu Xing,"Delicious food, optimal price, friendly service and super clean bathrooms: simply excellent."
Fu Xing,Very good value for money!
Fu Xing,
Bar Restaurant Europa,VERY DIRTY. Site with a comfortable terrace to enjoy outside. Very dirty services. A park in front for the little ones. Friendly but not too friendly. with little organization. Uninteresting burger. Rich bravas. Nice place to have a beer. They tend to get things wrong very often.
Bar Restaurant Europa,"Luis, Lidia and the whole team (cook and waitress) do everything they can to offer us a homemade menu, a breakfast, refreshments, a pleasant meeting... ALWAYS with careful attention and a human and close treatment. You have to take into account your resources and what we (as customers) are willing/able to invest when we are going to have a GOOD time at your establishment. Its called RECIPROCITY. If youve been there, I encourage you to give them a boost by rating positively And if you dont know them, look for the Europa hat in Placeta de lOca!!! THANK YOU for being there"
Bar Restaurant Europa,
Bar Restaurant Europa,"The food is good, its a Chinese bar, the toilets smell of pee, dark atmosphere, I didnt like it much, the girl was a bit rude"
Bar Restaurant Europa,"Bar regentat per orientals, menu de migdia elemental pero abondant (un dels pocs que deu quedar a la zona per sota de 10 euros), sense pretensions, el mobiliari interior porta ja molta guerra. Servei rapid i correcte. Reedito per un complement de menu de 2   no anunciat. No magraden els enganys! Han guanyat 2  i han perdut per sempre un client"
Bar Restaurant Europa,"Im a local and stopped by for a drink and a bite to eat a while ago. The atmosphere is noisy and annoying, you can find people drunk with beers and their children are disturbing the diners on more than one occasion. The service is fair and the food is nothing out of this world, for a little more money, there are better restaurants in the area."
Bar Restaurant Europa,"The owners are very kind, friendly, detailed and attentive. Very economical menu at  9.5. Quality homemade food. There are also sandwiches and tapas. It has a terrace. Located in Plaza de la Oca in Clot in the Sant Marti district. Clean place. I RECOMMEND IT."

Bar Restaurant Europa,The best in this bar is Alex the waiter. Is a crack. He has never seen a professional like him. Without Alex this bar is worthless
Bar Restaurant Europa,"The place is located in a very nice square, thats the good thing, the bad thing is the owner, who is rude, dirty and rude. The place is dirty, but the beer glass is good and clean, and they serve peanuts, which I love. I dont predict a great future for you, the owners have changed and things are not going well."

Bar Restaurant Europa,the food. is ok but wont go there again the service was good though
Bar Restaurant Europa,"The bar is great, Alex fantastic!! But children in families would have to be controlled by parents. Its not the bars problem, its the childrens parents. Parents should be made aware in general so that they take care of their children."
Bar Restaurant Europa,Excellent place and great attention. It hurts parents who dont take care of their children and let them run around the tables. Obviously the bar is not to blame.
Bar Restaurant Europa,Great bar to go for a few beers. The service is excellent and they usually have a stove on the terrace.

Bar Restaurant Europa,"My sister and I visited for a late night pitcher of sangria. It was muy delicioso. Bar Restaurant Europa has excellent quality drinks and even better service. Alex, or Mr. Clean, provided a very entertaining and engaging night. He showed us the proper way to pour sangria, took time out of his evening to speak with us, and made our experience very personal. Couldnt have gotten better service elsewhere. If I ran my own restaurant, Id hire Alex in an instant. Thats the kind of service Id want for my customers. !Muchas gracias, Alex! El servicio fue muy excelente."

Bar Restaurant Europa,"Good service and especially the waiter Alex, always with a smile, serving super well, thank you"
Bar Restaurant Europa,It was my first meal in Spain and it was very delicious.

RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,pricey for quality of food. Recommend to next restaurant in the same street.
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,First class experince
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"Beef tortilla ,it look good but taste bad. I discovered at the end that they are using processed meat instead of beef. It tastes like sausage."
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Awesome kebab
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Kebab is awesome Top service Everythings great Greetings from Poland

RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Lieu sale et nourriture pourri.
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Delicious ! We come back again n again. Food
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"I liked the place, we took the plateau, it was chicken, rice and salad. Large portion, we took it for two, we ate our fill. Service was quick, everything was fresh. Only the table was sticky."
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Excellent menu and preparation.
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"I rarely write bad reviews, but this place is Appalling. The chicken in the kebabs was almost raw. The burger patty was very undercooked. There was a cockroach crawling around on the table. Staff were distracted and not very competent. 4 out of our party of 6 did not eat our meal. Avoid at all costs."
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"There was no good service, every time we asked for something they ignored us and when we went up to the toilets they were in bad condition, it smelled very bad."
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"If you are vegan, or vegetarian, please do not even bother going here. Not only do they not carry a sufficient supply of falafel s, but they also use tongs for every preparation and don t wash their hands. They literally touch machines and food and don t have any hygienic procedures. Falafel s were also just dropped in a fryer, then put in my wrap, really nothing special. The only positive thing is they offered a discount since there wasn t enough falafel s, to be honest, I wanted to walk out, but I gave them my business anyways. Vegetarian options: Don t go if plant-based"
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,The chicken was good but it tasted too salty and it will silence your hunger.
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,A lot of meat in the kebabs!! Very nice! Super high CP value!
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Great and cheap food
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"Dont eat here, the meat was rotten. The Kebab did not feel fresh, they could become poisoned. The person who prepares the Kebabs does not use gloves to handle the food and also receives all the money with the same hand that prepares the Kebab."

RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Cheap and clean
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,Orreke
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"Very rich kebab, delicious meat, but the white sauce looks like mayonnaise. Its quite dirty really. The upstairs room is very comfortable and has privacy. I would recommend this kebab for its quality price, durum 5 euros and delicious. It is very well located on Las Ramblas."
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"Great food, great price, great portions"
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"4.50 euros for a kebab. It was cheap but the taste was a bit naff, a bit bland, didnt taste fresh. Fine if you need something to eat after a night out in Barcelona I guess."
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,
RESTAURANT ISTANBUL,"Although it may go unnoticed due to the size of the premises, it is a place where they serve you well, they make it clear And although it looks like a single table with a sofa, it really is a comfortable and quiet place to eat. And the quantity they give is good and the prices are also one of the best, without a doubt a place to return"

EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,Very fast & delicious...   I recommend it.
EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,"The best place to eat durum in all of Barcelona, without a doubt my favorite ! And for only 7 euros you can eat the menu of durum + Coca-Cola and fries, it is really delicious. 100% recommended. The attention is great."

EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,Very good
EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,Yesterday we went with my boyfriend and we were surprised. The taste was very good and the quality and price ratio is very good. It is by far one of the most economical and tasty. The best thing is that the flavor of the kebab was not so strong compared to other places. Highly recommended 10/10   greetings from Chileans
EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,"The best kebab I have ever tried, mixed, fresh vegetables, more than convenient price, I have tried kebab in Amenania, Italy and this is the best, great service and spectacular flavor, totally recommended"

EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,
EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,"The food is very good, the kebab tastes like a kebab, but the sauce they put on it, its sweet spiciness and the thick white sauce makes it mix with the cheese and is brutal. As for the fries, they season them and I think they are better than most franchises of this type recommended."
EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,

EL CAPRICHO KEBAB Y PIZZA,"Im still looking for my trusted Durum-Kebab because the one I had was transferred and I still cant find it. Im not very demanding when it comes to this type of fast food but in this case it didnt convince me much. I cant say its bad either because it isnt, its simply not what Im looking for, even though the quality/price ratio is not cheap, Ill give it more chances. Based on the reviews it has, I expected more."

La Bona Tapa,"The waiter was very nice but only him, for everything, bar, lounge and terrace. The hygiene is terrible and dont even think about going to the bathroom, months without using a mop and even more so without going over the sink!!

Bar Restaurant Can Chen,Food wasnt bad. Good price quality. Children also ate everything on their plate.

Bar Restaurant Can Chen,"Dont go unless you have no choice. I had fried rice (arroz frito), and the reason it was cheap was because the portion was small. The rice was really hard, the rest of the ingredients were fresh, and the rice was lukewarm and not hot. Its like theyre giving you something youve already done"

Bar Restaurant Can Chen,I ordered scallop and they served me breaded or battered chicken. I told him that the escalope used to be beef and he told me that they always make it that way. I have also seen another user who has posted some supposedly macaroni bolognese. I guess they are not very clear about the translation of each thing.
Bar Restaurant Can Chen,

Bar Restaurant Can Chen,
Bar Restaurant Can Chen,"Fatal. Do not go there. Minus one. We went to have some drinks on the terrace, and at the end, when we asked for the bill, there was one more. We let the waitress know and she yelled back that she kept the exact bill. Its not about the extra euros. Simply, the manners. We paid and left despite knowing that the bill did not correspond to what was consumed. Very little empathy Luckily there are many bars in Barcelona to return to."
Bar Restaurant Can Chen,Pleasant atmosphere. Sympathy on the part of the waiters.
Bar Restaurant Can Chen,"Tourist rip-off, you order a tortilla patatas for  3.95 and you get 1/4. A water  1.80 Even in Park Guell the water only costs  1.

Bar Restaurant Can Chen,Too bad. The photos do not represent in the slightest what is served. I asked for pasta and what I received was this tragedy.
La Parada @ El Nacional,"The food was blah  not crazy about it at all. Just stayed because we wanted a place to sit. Service is ok, not bad, not amazing. The atmosphere was great though, but you get the same music at any other place at El Nacional"
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Food was bad, my friends lasagna was burnt, my pasta tasted like microwave pasta. for 6 pieces of tiny cheese they charge 12 Euros which is ridiculous. Come one, get real Food"
La Parada @ El Nacional,Too expensive and not really good
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Space that shares several gastronomic offers, well decorated and very popular. The offers range from oysters, meats, fish or Mediterranean cuisine. La Parada is Mediterranean cuisine. Very slow service, we had Caesar salad, ravioli, glass bread with tomato and an assortment of cheeses. Everything is correct, just like the price, it is not expensive. A place to go very occasionally."
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Very nice dinner. The environment is ideal. We had to wait a little, normal given the dates. The service was very attentive although somewhat slow. The food was very good, the fake risotto spectacular. To improve only pumpkin hummus, you cant call it hummus, its basically pumpkin puree. However, we would return to try other interesting dishes."
La Parada @ El Nacional,Vegetarian options: El falso risoto estaba buenisimo! Y los raviolis de calabaza exquisitos Food
La Parada @ El Nacional,A magnificent place to enjoy in company
La Parada @ El Nacional,"They recommended the place to us because it must be fashionable. The truth is that the atmosphere is very good, it is a huge ship decorated with taste and different spaces. As there was no reservation for the meat and the fish one without room (it was a holiday). We sat at the stop and the service was great, kind and friendly people. The letter is somewhat short. The food is good although the prices are sky-high. We ordered an assortment of cheeses for  13 and they brought us 2 cheese slices. We looked like fools hahaha. The cokes were good. We will try another place next time."
La Parada @ El Nacional,
La Parada @ El Nacional,"First off, thank you so much for having a great selection of vegan options. Unfortunately they fell short in terms of portion size and the excessive oil amount used . The vegan pesto, the raviolis and the lasagna were tasty. I was disappointed to only get 5-6 raviolis, the vegan lasagna was an oil slick and the amount of vegan pesto pasta given in comparison to the bolonesa was extremely unequal. I would love to see this restaurant make an effort to improve their vegan options. If anything, lower the prices if you re going to keep portion sizes the same."
La Parada @ El Nacional,They go slower than a turtle and the food is very normal
La Parada @ El Nacional,
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Cow poop!!!! expensive and the dishes are not ridiculous, the next thing, slow for a while, the cheese board, two pieces of each and three types of cheese????? We will never return"
La Parada @ El Nacional,
La Parada @ El Nacional,I liked the food and the service was good. The place is very cute
La Parada @ El Nacional,Very beautiful and impressive place Particularly noisy on the other hand but hey... its Spain
La Parada @ El Nacional,"An old-fashioned  Far West  robbery but without covering yourself with a scarf. The tapas looked like clippings from the menu itself that the slices of ham weighed less than the  20 bill you pay with the bread. Regarding the service, we are going to say that the waitresses were very unpleasant and did not let us put the tables together so that the couples could be together, answering in a derogatory tone to my young friend Montse  I told her that it is not possible, maam!  With a devilish look. Throughout the service process they were in a hurry and in bad manners and pushing us to leave because they wanted to pick up. He told us that there were two separate tables and that he would charge us separately, when he brought the bill they did not let us pay separately in visa or cash by bringing the bills for the two tables. We collected the money and when we got up to leave a rude voice said:  wait and dont leave until we count the money. As if we were criminals. In my opinion, the service has been disastrous and the price, well we cannot say that we did not see the menu but the quantity and quality was poor like the soul of the waitress who served us. Recommendation, that the people who work there should have a little more tact, that empathy and attitude are inherent to working on them for personal growth and being more pleasant as a person with others in the public. Everything and that, after all we leave a tip, we say goodbye with good night and thanks, lets see if something sticks to them... We will not return for sure."
La Parada @ El Nacional,Before I start my comment I would like to say that I am very shocked at the bad comments this place has. Because my experience was fabulous. The service from the entrance to the waitress who took our order to the waitress who brought the food was excellent. We didnt even have time to take photos because the food was delicious. I can really recommend it :)
La Parada @ El Nacional,"The service is really bad. They served us a gazpacho that was stale and fermented and the head waiter insisted that it was good... based on saying that the other diners had not complained. When I told him that its because almost all of them were tourists, he had the audacity to tell me no, that almost all of them were locals (as if we were idiots). At first he told us that we would have to pay for the dish if we returned it, and when he saw that he was going to ask for the complaint form, he ran to talk to the chef and they agreed to change the dish. In short, one of the worst services I have seen in Barcelona. The head waiter at night was called Paola, and if it was up to me she would be out of a job forever. El Nacional should take care of its image a little more. Having so many visitors does not justify giving such poor service and mediocre food. Not everything goes."
La Parada @ El Nacional,Terrible quality for Spain try any other restaurant in the national. Food was uninspired Service unaware Food : 1/5
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Our waitress was very friendly but they brought the starter at the same time than the main courses. The place is trendy and huge, it regroups 8 different restaurants. The pasta was good for me, my friend found it excellent. The bread and tomatoes was kind of a joke as we had to make it ourselves."
La Parada @ El Nacional,Do not go! Microwaved pasta and tiny portions. Not at all worth it!
La Parada @ El Nacional,
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting service. Food not worth the price. Salads are pretty fresh."
La Parada @ El Nacional,We were delighted with the place. Affordable prices to be inside the National. Good portions and very good food.
La Parada @ El Nacional,
La Parada @ El Nacional,(-) My friend has a very strong nut allergy and asked the waitress multiple times if the dishes she ordered contain them. She was told that they do not. It came as a surprise to us all when we realised that the dishes did in fact contain nuts- they were hidden in the hummus. (+) The canelloni I ordered were very good and our initial waitress found a table for us very quickly which was a big plus.
La Parada @ El Nacional,This was the worst meal we had in Spain. We ordered the salmon healthy bowl and tagliatelle Bolognese pasta. They didn t clarify that the salmon was smoked and they gave like 4 small pieces. The pasta was mushy and tasted microwaved. The pasta sauce also had no flavor. We also ordered water for the table and they gave us each a bottle so we had to pay for each. Felt like we got scammed.
La Parada @ El Nacional,Don t bother! We sat with a view of the kitchen and the 3 microwaves were used non stop which is fine if the food is nice but our 4 pasta dishes were all dry and over cooked. There was little to no sauce as it had evaporated and we were left with a claggy mess. The only thing I would give credit for were the flatbreads but they were measly for the price and not fit for a main course.
La Parada @ El Nacional,Awful service. One of the starters got after the main dishes.
La Parada @ El Nacional,"The tagliatelle bolognese was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend it, with a little bit more salt would be perfect."
La Parada @ El Nacional,No Crepe
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Tiny portions at a very high price. A cheese board for 13 euros with just 6 pieces of cheese. The same with the sausages. And the quality is pretty standard for what they offer. It is the only restaurant where you dont have to expect much from those in El Nacional, for that reason."
La Parada @ El Nacional,"Inside the famous El National which brings together several different venues in one large area for an offer that satisfies all palates... from fish to meat, in a really crowded and not very relaxing but very characteristic environment. The restaurant offers a varied cuisine that did not impress me. Fast and kind service, for 2 starters and a first course of pasta I found the price a little high but still average here in Barcelona."

TAKO restaurant Cuina Japonesa,"They do not have vegetarian meals, only two dishes and if you do not want to eat because there is no variety and accompany your friends they make you pay the same."
Atik Restaurant,"The first night we visited was great, the food was amazing (do try the pizza!) and the staff were super friendly. The second night we had a different waitress and she was kinda rude which put the vibes off a bit. The food was still tasty though. It was just nice to relax on the rooftop. They also have heaters and blankets when its too chilly."

Atik Restaurant,Les tapas sont delicieux et copieux.Tres bons vins et alcools et surtout le personnel est avenant.
Atik Restaurant,Cubik hotel restaurant. The food was really bad and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Go there for a drink (and more...) and for the swimming pool (if you sleep at the hotel)
Curry house restaurant Halal,"Horrible tasting curries, forgot to include one naan too. Looks like curries from a tin from the supermarket"
Curry house restaurant Halal,"I ordered butter chicken, and I have no idea what arrived. The oil and the sauce had separated, and no matter how much I mixed it, it did not combine. It smelt sweet but and tasted very acidic. No one in the house could eat it. This was at the end of the night, so I think that the chef just threw something in a box and sent it to me. I would rather you had cancelled my order then send me this. If you arent happy to cook at a certain time, change your hours on Uber eats."

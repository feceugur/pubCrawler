Sallès Hotel Pere IV,we were recently visiting barcelona for the first time and stayed at this hotel. the area that the hotel is situated in is not ideal for those looking to explore barcelona. it is in a sketchy area that is desolate and everything is covered in grafitti. seems kind of like a ghost town area where there were previously a lot of establishments that were closed down and boarded up. it is not near anything. the hotel itself looks beautiful and modern and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful.,"[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8031401}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.18076442}, {'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.016095424}]","['front desk staff', 'ghost town area']"

Gràcia Llatina, the music doesn't sound very good. the sound system is poorly equalized or they simply play the music very low. at the back of the place it is so hot that it is impossible to be there. those who serve at the bar are too busy and there are only two of them so they have a bad face and are fed up with living :( selection of music from the group very very good.,"[{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9104215}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07746543}, {'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.012113071}]",['sound system']
